Or better if I just had it be a futuristic soldier with samurai heritage set on another planet?', \"If you use a samurai from feudal Japan who is catapulted into the far future, and you want it to be realistic, you will need to do massive amounts of research to get everything correct.  It's not simply a matter of reading a couple of books, you'd need to be able to get into the mindset of someone who is born into a wholly different era with a wholly different culture, and you'll have to become an expert on every aspect of his life and times.  Only you know if this amount of research is something which would come easily to you or which you would find congenial, but to be frank if this were something you'd enjoy doing I rather think you'd have started the process so you wouldn't need to be asking our opinion on the subject generally.\", '', \"If you're writing about someone who is born in the future, whether or not on a different planet, then again you need to immerse yourself in a wholly different culture and era, but the advantage is that you control that future and its culture, and if you don't know some aspects of the man's samurai heritage or you get it wrong, it can be glossed as a consequence of that heritage having been altered or diluted over the centuries.\", '', \"However, I have to ask -- why are you so intent on getting a samurai into your story?  Why use something which is so clichéd?  Invent your own warrior caste.  Work out when and why they arose, and then use different aspects of different cultures and meld them into something which is unique because it's all come from you.  That to me would be far more satisfying, and much less problematic.\", \"As a VR character  in game the Samurai  becomes self aware  of the fact that he's a fictional character . He gets loose , finds a  mechanical humanoid avatar and explores  the the world has adventures he couldn't had  in the game he existed in.\", 'I don\\'t know - if you got your samuri from the Tokugawa period (1603-1867), especially near the end of the period, instead of a \"battle-hardened, sword-wielding ninja, quoting zen couplets\", you would have likely got a stuck up, impoverished civil servant who hadn\\'t seen a fight in his life....although having tangled with a few scary civil servants, there were a few times I think I\\'d have rather taken my chances with a stoic warrior with a big sword instead.', \"Hi! Reading through this thread, there already seems to be a ton of helpful advice coming from writers way more experienced than me, so I can't offer much more than this:\", '', \"If you're still really banking on the samurai / any historical Japanese social class and worried about stereotyping or possibly being disrespectful, have you considered hiring a sensitivity reader? Of course, this would require you to pay money and probably have at least a manuscript for them to review. Google says that the rates usually start at around 250USD for a novel manuscript, which isn't terrible but everyone's financial situation is different.\", '', \"Some people have strong opinions on sensitivity readers, but I think involving someone who comes from a group/culture you're writing about that you yourself are not a part of can be a valuable experience. Plus, it shows that you're committed to doing your research and being respectful to the source material. Just be careful of scammers lol\", \"I'm thinking of doing it this way and save the samurai idea for a better time fitting period. Though I really would like to incorporate something samurai into my future story, because the antagonist would be running some kind of doomsday like cults and using the Bushido-like code to brainwash those to follow and die for them would be very well fitting. Think of like a martial arts mcdojo or bullshido school that uses brainwashing tactics on some of their students, which is set in modern times. They are not neccesarily experts in samurai or whatever culture their style is based on, of the knowledge, history and culture of it. In fact, they probably wouldn't even have the true respect for the culture if they can use it for profit or gain.\", '', '', \"I would love to. I know I wouldn't have the budget for it. And I'd have to watch out for getting scammed like you said. Maybe I can talk to those who are from that background and culture to get a better idea?\", \"The original concept of this is rather like a book from the early 70's. The protagonist is a very skilled mercenary who upgrades a samurai based mercenary company in an environment of corporate warfare. I cannot remember the author or the title, though. Very interesting concept that was nicely developed as I recall.\", 'I just recently watched \"Alita: Battle Angel,\" which is a movie based on a manga. It has a cyberpunk setting with the lead character being skilled in marital arts using a very Samurai-like sword. I hope this does not dissuade anyone from writing this style of story, rather, it indicates that there is a market for it.']"

Great idea -would be interesting to have each Chapter refer to tracks/ albums so the whole story is a sort of Metal encyclopedia that has ya checking out soap tunes as you go along (would love to do the same thing with cookery, with a meal per chapter).\", 'Anyway, good luck (will post back if I figure why I found the plot hard to follow)', 'I listened to some of it, with podcasts I find I can’t do much of anything else while I’m listening. Maybe I will resume ep. 1 where I left off.', '', 'Admittedly, the plot has some errors (I wrote this years ago). Cookery would be awesome.

My notes below', '', '1) I think the concept as I understand it (various types of sensory outputs are banned, and rebels fight back to claim their favored sense) Has a lot of promise, and it reads to me as having a 70s/80s style cyberpunk vibe that is beloved by those who love it.', '', '2) That said, like AnRoinn I was lost throughout the story. The slang, the shifting between spaces, and what I think as an attempt to explain multiple world elements at once overwhelmed me. Admittedly, I am probably not the sort of audience for this sort of thing.', '', '3) If you are going to emphasize metal, I would stay there. The Gershwin note is interesting, but right now Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin are the classics, if not the oldies, so you could get the same impact from them. However, if you wanted to go a Farenheight 451/ Mr. Burns Post-Electric show conceit where the banning of music has meant that the possession of any music is revolutionary and punk, that could be really interesting. Having and listening to the only Gershwin in existence is pretty darn metal.', '', '4) The \"Noise is outlawed\" idea is so big that I think we need to sit with it for a little while before the other subplots and cyberpunk tech get added. I rarely recommend this, but this is the sort of story where a prologue could help. Man walks down the street whistling and gets placed in shackles, that sort of thing. Since your protagonist is going to get away with making noise, seeing someone get caught may set expectation and stakes.', \"Who is this story about?

In the meantime, I've put up some of the main points here\", '', \"As I mention there, it's not adviseable to quote music lyrics, as music publishers/copyright owners tend to be very protective of their work, and quoting anything more than a single line is likely to cost a lot of money.  Songs which are now in the public domain can be quoted without repercussion or payment -- for something like a poem it would be 70 years from the poet's death, and so I imagine (but I've not checked) that for lyrics it would be 70 years from the lyricist's death.\", '', \"There are exceptions made, ie allowing for more to be quoted, where it's done for the purposes of parody.  So someone writing a spoof novel would have more room to quote the original, and I imagine that would also be the case for someone spoofing music lyrics.\", '', \"Quoting a song title is OK as far as I'm aware -- certainly I've not come across any case law that suggests otherwise.\", '', 'Changing the lyrics of a song should be OK, since it wouldn\\'t then be a breach of copyright but the creation of a new lyric, as long as the changes aren\\'t tiny ones eg changing a lyric of \"Sitting working on my novel on my laptop in my bedroom\" to \"Sitting working on my poem on my laptop in my bedroom\" likely wouldn\\'t be enough, unless done as a parody.', '', \"Using the name of a real group, or using a slightly changed name, wouldn't be a breach of copyright, though it's possible that (1) there might be an issue if the name were trademarked (though even then just referring to the group would be OK) and (2) there is the possibility of defamation if the group and/or its members are libelled eg such as insinuating, even by way of parody, that the lead singer is a child molester.  (For more on that last point, I'll be doing a talk on defamation in the March Chronscast.)\", '', 'Does that cover all your concerns?', 'Yeah, thanks judge. I think I’ll finish that podcast.

Fennec didn't guide it, it found its own way inside and back to its master.\", '', \"The three blinking lights could just be it, lights, but yeah, who know maybe it also has some sort of offensive capability since it belongs to a master assassin. If it feeds tracking information to Fennec's visor it's an uber device.\", '', '', '', 'Okay, a few questions:', \"- First of all, the timeline. It felt like Boba only spent a fortnight or so amongst the Tusken Raiders, but now he states that it's been years between the time he was gobbled up by the Sarlaac and his encounter with Fennec (which makes sense, since The Mandalorian is set in 9 ABY and Return of the Jedi in 4 ABY), so he spent, what, five years with the Tuskens? Or did he spend five years in the Sarlaac?\", '- Boba came out of the Sarlaac wearing his armor. Then he woke up on the sand without it. Why does he assume the Sarlaac somehow strip him of his armor and swallowed it again?', \"- Why does Boba need to spend so much time in bacta at all if he did without it for five years? Clearly, it's not pain related. Clearly he doesn't need the bacta to survive. So what? He doesn't like the scars? He can't stand the sight of his wrinkled skin in a mirror?\", '- Boba spends two hours (?) inside the Sarlaac covered in indestructible beskar and crawls out weakened, barely conscious and covered in burns. Years later he re-enters the Sarlaac in a bathrobe and climbs back out covered in acid slime and yet unscathed. Anyone care to explain how this acid works? Does it just cook armor?', '- It took four episodes for Boba to explain why he so desperately wants to become a crime lord (good job, screenwriters!) but I still don\\'t understand. Why oh why does he want to take Jabba\\'s place? If he wanted to retire, if his stay amongst the Tuskens convinced him to give up on crime for five years, how did their deaths suddenly change that? Is it a matter of \"Criminals killed my friends so I\\'ll become a crime lord to avenge them\"? And if he just wants to become a crime lord because he figured it\\'s time for him to become the boss rather than one of the underlings, why do it on this god-forsaken planet and over a criminal empire in tatters? Why not fly to Coruscant and take on the biggest drug cartel there? I just don\\'t understand his motivation.', \"- Why does Boba talk so much? Why does he always look so confused?  Why does he always need Fennec to explain to him how the criminal underworld works? He's Boba Fett, the most fearsome bounty hunter in Star Wars lore, the one even the Empire relied on. He spent his entire life amongst criminals. Where is the\", ', ruthless, reliable fighter that stood toe to toe with Darth Vader?', '- Disney needed Boba Fett to be a more compassionate, kind, animal-loving character because they\\'re Disney and they can\\'t have ruthless killers driving ships called \"Slave 1\" starring in their own TV shows, and to be honest, I can get behind that. But then... why have a compassionate and kind animal lover seek to become a crime lord? It just doesn\\'t make sense to me, and all it results in is him looking like a half-assed, gutless crime lord with no self-respect. If you want him to become a hero, have him become a police officer or a bantha herder, I don\\'t know...', \"- Fennec is the only character acting like the Boba Fett from the original trilogy. She's the one coming up with the plans instead of running her mouth. She's the one with the cool gadgets. She's the one kicking butts while Boba wipes the floor or chases silly dog droids in Jabba's kitchen - even though he could have taken its back in under one second. Was Boba Fett actually Benny Hill in armor all along? I hope Boba dies and Fennec inherits the armor in the last episode.\", \"I don't have nearly as many questions as\", 'but I do wonder if we are now done with the dual story. Or are we perhaps going to see in more detail how Boba Fett actually becomes the \"crime lord.\" We just see him taking the throne. It must have been some sort of subterfuge that put him there. Because it didn\\'t look like the smoldering remains of an all out fight.', 'I suspect in the tradition of dual but parallel storylines in SW (and literature) we might see the takeover of Bib’s throne along with the battle against the Pyke Syndicate.', '', 'I think we’ve seen all the scenes from the trailers so it’s all new stuff now on.', \"Can't wait for Disney's new spinoff series starring the Sarlaac. There's a whole lot of people in the galaxy to eat.\", '', 'I\\'m starting to sense a pattern with the show in that some bits are a bit radical and \"out there\", and sometimes it fails to make sense, but other times it\\'s intriguing and building to a more interesting wider story. All in all a good show but with many weak points.', '', \"If Boba is no longer bounty hunting then it doesn't hurt to rename his ship - fits the character arc despite the Disney politics behind it. It's such a beautiful ship, and the episode made it as imposing as ever.\", '', 'Hoping the dual timelines are over. Was interesting with the Tuskens but would be great to move on from that now.', 'Well, there are certain Mando related stuff that can still come in the A and B storylines. In the present time I am expecting at least one of the clans showing interest for the offering that Mando has for the wardogs. Some of them are mercs. And what Crawling Chaos writes is valid, I cannot argue, but some of it I would put it down on his perspective.', '', \"I could try to defend the series, but what is the point, Disney needs to learn about what we write. It's same thing that AMC does with TWD series. We put down valid critique and unique perspectives. From Dave's and Jon's PoV all that we write should be interesting because it gives the series longevity and I for one want to see another season of Boba. Especially if he's going to be sarcastic.\", '', \"In the original movies it's something close to three lines that he puts out. He is very stoic (and introvert) in today and I'm stoic (and introvert) in nature, so I recognise him on small screen. What Disney has put out has given much richer look to this fabulous and somewhat dark character.\", '', '', '', \"Tbh, I don't think the show runners put a tremendous amount of effort into the timeline. I think they just expect you to go with it as its a show about space wizards, uber-violent teddy bears and muscle blokes with pig heads.\", '', '', \"I didn't fully understand this either. Didn't he try to resist the Jawas as they took his armour at one point?\", '', '', \"I think it's to get rid of the lasting effects of the Sarlacc's acid venom.\", '', '', '“You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the Pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful', '. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.” ―C-3PO', '', 'It takes 1,000 years to digest a human. The acid is weak but somehow gets into the tissues and causes immense pain.', '', '', \"The answer is... so Disney could make bank on exploiting IP. But seriously, I'm not sure either. I think you're just supposed to go with it and let the lasers and celebrity guest appearances numb your critical faculties.\", '', '', 'Welcome to 2022, man.', \"Well, you have a lot more questions than me. I thought the Sand People/Tusken Raiders episode was better. At least it wasn't as poor as last weeks.\", '', \"I'm not sure that the comedy in this series works. It certainly needs more refinement. Are robots that make peculiar noises intrinsically funny?\", '', \"I wasn't aware of the name change/Disney politics and I obviously don't want to get into social politics here, but you are aware that there are other definitions of the word Slave, especially those relating to Slave Machines? (direct-coupled machines) (mechanical technology - the configuration of motors such as two motors connected to different drives that are acting on the same load) (computer technology - a large processor used to handle large jobs). So, personally I never saw the name to be offensive, but more that Boba Fett and his ship were an inextricably linked partnership of man and machine. However, I'm willing to learn new things, and I do every day here.\", '', \"Yes, I guess the earlier split storyline has now caught up with the latter. I had read that this show was a single season and ran directly into the Mandalorian Season 2, so we will shortly catch up with Boba's appearance in that, and then the stories will continue together as the same show.\", \"The rat catcher droid (along with the server droid in Jennifer Beals' bar that looks like the Smash robots from the ad) feature quite frequently in the animated series - this might explain the humour. The chef droid is the same kind as the one on the refugee ship Anakin and Padme use when leaving Coruscant in AOTC, and EV-9D9 is the torture droid from ROTJ (it tortures a Gonk droid in Jabba's palace) and makes R2 the server droid.\"]"

I dislike CGI cartoons immensely: The textures are always too clean, too smooth, which is practically the antithesis of what you'd expect from a Blade Runner cartoon, and the animation always hits that nasty spot of being too realistic for its cartoonish visuals yet too twitchy and clumsy to look real.

In fact it seems much closer to the thriving, neon-lit megacity of 2019 (in Blade Runner lore, the year the first movie was set in) than the post-blackout, storm-swept and desolate world of 2049 (the year the sequel was set in).\", '', \"The last peeve I'll mention is the soundtrack.

I\\'m a fan of GitS too but I never managed to get past the first SAC 2045 episode and I tried at least 3 times. First and foremost I blame the smooth textures again but also that darn car chase in the desert... Usually you start a show with a bang to capture the attention of the viewers. When I watch a GitS cartoon, the last thing I\\'d call a \"bang\" is a scene in an empty, bland desert of smooth sand. I want a maze of skyscrapers and neon signs everywhere.

As for Black Lotus, I can confirm that the biggest hurdle is making it through episodes 1 - 3, and it does get a bit better later on.\", \"If you like Cowboy Bebop, try Space Dandy next.

All of which goes to make the progression that much more plausible. This one did leave me feeling a bit downbeat; I'm not sure exactly why but possibly because the last part is set in early colonial Australia with lots of blatant corruption and brutality towards the transported convicts that clearly appalled both Aubrey and Maturin, and inevitably the reader along with them.

But it was only short (read in one session) and not (unlike some I could name) an unreasonable price for a novella. So I went ahead and found myself disappointed as a Hamilton reader and impressed as a Powell reader; make of that what you will! It is an enjoyable space opera romp with an interesting time manipulation twist. But... it felt very derivative of both Alastair Reynolds' House of Suns - the whole Light Chasers concept could have been lifted almost without modification from that book - and, bizarrely, Hamilton's own Salvation Sequence - the whole tachyon time manipulation bit (trying to avoid spoilers here) felt like an only slightly modified rehash of that part of the Salvation Sequence. So a little disappointing as it didn't feel particularly unique which is sort of what I look for in a novella. 3/5 stars.\"]"

Published in 1991, it has some interesting slants on FIAWOL.', \"I remember the sf versus sci-fi debate when I discovered Science Fiction Review (and therefore fandom) in the mid seventies. SF was genre science fiction and sci-fi was what the non-fan accepted as science fiction, usually stuff fans looked down on. Fans would frequently use skiffy in pace of sci-fi to degrade it further. For better or worse I bought into it and still do to the extent I only use sf or SF when referring to science fiction. I feel a bit self conscious using first Fandom's stf. I think it was Alexei Panchen who used the term mimetic fiction to refer to the mainstream, that is, non-sf.\", 'I know little about American culture relating to this, and I see sci-fi as an American term, but from a British perspective, I do know that for anyone growing up in England in the \\'50\\'s, \\'60\\'s and 70\\'s, anyone who liked reading science fiction was thought of as weird, a geek, and a nerd. I know of only two boys who read Marvel \"comic books\" at school and they were both shunned in the same way that train spotters still are today. I worked in Public Libraries in holidays in the 1980\\'s and the science fiction shelves were still, even then, considered not to be very literary. We did read some at school but it was considered childish and something you would grow out of later. There was very little science fiction on TV. Even Star Trek was shown at time slots that favoured children watching. Science fiction films were generally cheesy until 2001: A Space Odyssey came along. It was never mainstream until after Star Wars.', '', \"What I'm saying is that the reality was the complete opposite of that quote. It was the others who prided themselves on their intellectual superiority over these nerds, but people who are picked upon generally do form allegiances to fight back. I accept that you need to have some mathematics or physics education to understand some Hard Science Fiction, and probably some IT knowledge to really get cyberpunk, but there was also a massive change in culture in the '80's and '90's and it wasn't anything to do with the opening up of some secret society. It was simply the fact that science fiction and fantasy became popular enough that it was no longer embarrassing to say that you liked it anymore. After that, actual mainstream popular TV and films began to feature fantasy and science fiction storylines, such as characters seeing UFOs.\", \"I couldn't say I've ever heard of this!

My experience was 70s and 80s, and being a fan of scifi - particularly in secondary school (ages 11+) was that it wasn't something you mentioned unless you wanted to leave yourself open to ridicule. Being a fan of sci-fi mags, tv and films was seen as something for adolescents - usually male - and something that we would grow out of. Being a computer owner at the time was not entirely different. The thing is though, that because it wasn't something usually talked about, you never knew quite how popular it might be. And when you were invited round to the cool kid's house one night and saw his boxed collection of Zoids/He Man/Star Wars (not that he'd ever admit it), you realised that there were actually more people out there than you realised.\", '', 'And just like with computer owners*, when you found others like you, kindred spirits, there would be some kind of bond between you, and you would happily chat together as a group about the latest computer game or scifi tv programme.

Yes, there are more people interested in it, but newcomers haven't had to go through the tough times when it wasn't so popular; it becomes a bit less 'special'. A bit like when you've supported a football club in the bottom division, and now that they are in the Premier League suddenly everyone is a fan.\", '', \"Perhaps some decided to 'close ranks' and disassociate themselves from the newcomers by making their interest less accessible? I don't know if this is the case, but I do know that in computer gaming 'casual gamer' was a (usually derogatory) term used to  refer to those who came late on the scene (around the time of the Sony Playstation)\", '', 'As Dave mentions, it was never a case of science fiction fans thinking we are intellectually superior; if anything it was the mainstream considering that science fiction was intellectually inferior to other genres.', '', \"You only have to look at the vast majority of science fiction tv and films that were made in the 60s/70/80s; it was almost universally scheduled to be shown in family or children's viewing slots. If you watch many of the shows you can clearly see that they were designed for an adult audience, but at best made it into the family viewing slots, and never the 9pm+ watershed time when the 'adult' programmes were shown.\", '', \"Again the same applies to computer gamily - we have a multi million, now multi-billion pound industry, and yet it can't get even one regular tv programme out of all the copshow, reality tv and soap operas shown on tv. And why? Because I still think for some still in charge in broadcasting it's seen as something that we'll grown out of and is only for kids, and is inferior to more 'intellectual' programmes.\", '', \"Which is why we have very little science fiction on tv today. No matter how popular, it never seems to find a way into types of show we see on telly today. You'd think that one night a week, one hour a night, there would be room for a science fiction drama?\", \"There's a lot of naysayers on the internet. Or as I like to call them, imbeciles.\", \"I'm interested if this was a British perspective or was the same elsewhere. Given that in Back to the Future Marty's 1950's dad is a would-be science fiction writer who never succeeds because he is bullied by Biff, I would assume that it is not. In which case, I'd say that Gwen C. Katz has little knowledge of what she is talking about.\", '', \"I'd also agree with\", \"that computer users and D+D players fell into the same grouping.

Also the enormous growth of MMPOGs during the 1990's which were invariably science fiction based . Over Christmas we met some in-law relations in their late 50's who were enthusiastically reminiscing about such games like the Halo franchise. They weren't people who I would have ever thought would have been first adopters of computer technology in the 1980's, but maybe they were too, in secret.\", '', '', 'It sells magazines and gets social media hits from outraged people. It is always best not to feed the Trolls on the internet.', \"Since Stranger Things seems to have made D&D acceptable to the masses, I have seen people claim that us players in the 80s were elitist and did our best to keep outsiders, especially girls, out of the game. Personally I only discussed D&D with my fellow players. I was also thought odd by some for reading sci fi, well just reading in general. I would have loved to have introduced more people to D&D back then when I was around 14, and i would have welcomed any girls with open arms. I too remember the cult rumours and the newspaper stories about devil worship, in fact when i was 17 one of my friends became a born again Christian and burnt all the D&D books in his possession, including some of mine and other friends he had borrowed.

More so, their memories are tailored to make them compliant (same as us being brainwashed, yet more so). They are still stronger and have a higher tolerance for pain, but we see how the moment one has a free thought and diverges from their programming, they're executed. They're still constantly--openly--threatened and insulted (like the cop lunging at the protagonist calling him a 'skin-job,' graffiti on his door, and how everyone speaks to them). Even Love wrestles with the brutality by Wallace, clearly afraid...so in a constant state of fear.\", '', \"That said, I have very personal reasons why slavery in any form enrages me. What most people fail to realize--just as shown in the film--just as in real life, is after all of the crushing oppression to use up the very last bits of a slave, there is only one end for ALL of them...an end they're constantly threatened with, death.

Finally, his redemption at doing the human thing of saving Deckard and reuniting him with the child. For me, that is what I take emotionally from the film.\", '', 'Neither are very cheery though', '~', \"True. The baseline test is probably the strongest part of the movie. But notice how much it takes to push the blade runner past the parameters of an acceptable tolerance. He can always secretly think what he likes about his job (and clearly does) but it's only when he is turned upside down emotionally that the machine goes\", \". So if he doesn't discover that he's actually human born (extremely unlikely and not true in his case) he should be fine. The threat of death is not that dire.\", '', '', \"But nobody attacks him or beats him up. He is treated adequately by his boss (no worse than some bosses I know), gets decent pay, a nice pad and good company. I'm guessing a lot of humans in 2049 would secretly wish to trade places with him.\", '', \"Wallace is the dangerous centre of power in the 2049 world, and anyone should be afraid of him, humans as well as replicants, as he is quite ruthless. I hadn't noticed that much fear in Love - she clearly emulates the ruthlessness of her creator.\", '', '', \"Replicant slavery in 2049 doesn't appear to be that bad - all the replicants in the movie live no worse than the humans and most live better - fancy being a trashland orphan? The blade runner isn't 'used up'. He is constructed in such a way and given the technological aids to recover quickly from his injuries and he gets time off, nice digs and a virtual girlfriend. If that's slavery then plenty of rats in the rat race are slaves too. The real slaves in 2049 are the orphans - they're literally worked to death and live in constant terror.\", '', \"Historically, slavery was a complicated thing. The Hollywood portrayal of slaves: chained, half-naked, underfed and worked to exhaustion, by and large didn't exist. The only place it did exist was in Hitler's concentration camps and Stalin's Gulag. It is the modern world that invented large-scale abject slavery.

Be sure of this...it doesn't matter what nation, state, or town you live in throughout the world, there are slaves NEAR YOU this instant who face the threat of death constantly, and will do so until they either wear out and perish or are 'disposed of' by those who enslave them. It is not even worth the risk for those who own slaves to sell them (since the buyer might be irresponsible and might lose control of them risking the original owner).

In this case, one side has become a purely corporate autocracy and the other side has become an militarized mishmash of undemocratic civilian control and an almost anarchic military. So no one book is specifically anti-corporate (and I feel that Campbell isn\\'t making a strictly anti-corporate pitch - just pointing out how when elements of a society are extreme and not in their proper place, the society suffers), but the theme is a core element of the series. Then the Lost Stars series (which follows the first and runs parallel to the \"Beyond the Frontier\" series which directly sequels the first one) is set in those Syndic corporate-fascism worlds as one of them tries to become more democratic while dealing with the remnants of other corporate-fascist worlds.', '', 'Finally, on', ', this is another book that\\'s remarkably prescient.

The core prescient corporate element is that Europe is essentially run by a Blackwater-like private mercenary corporation that, along with religious fundamentalists (who are actually just another form of corporation) basically run everything, except for Our Heroes, the pitiful band of rebels who resist them. It\\'s a trilogy (also recently revised as one updated book which probably wasn\\'t necessary, though I can\\'t say because I haven\\'t read it) and each book is arguably not quite as good as its predecessor but it still ends pretty strongly, which is a testament to how great the first book is.

I was approached by a visitor at my job who asked: \"Can you tell me why so much science-fiction is so bad?\" I had no good answer for him.', '', 'In the present, there is a tendency to go for quick and easy. However, as our Managing Editor has said, \"Ninety percent of a good book is research.\" Writing fiction means knowing about \\'real world\\' mythology. And not just Greek or Roman. Specific books are bought for specific settings and time periods. Our ME has read hundreds of books. It\\'s not necessary to read everything but having good, solid references is very important.', '', 'In my experience, the writer needs to go beyond what is just in his head to create a three-dimensional world and characters. Established, formal methods of writing exist because they work and every new writer has to start somewhere.', 'What in particular did they think was bad regarding science fiction?', 'There was nothing further that was said. I knew what he was talking about. A few issues are these: Writing to suit perceived trendy topics as opposed to an entertaining story. Science-fiction began to veer away from entertaining the reader in the 1980s. There was one author I liked and this person went on to win an award.', '', \"Another culprit was writing stories that the author wanted to write but which did not sit well with a larger audience. In other words, authors need to know what the average SF reader wants and likes and what they do not like. In the 1980s, elements began to appear in stories that had no business being there. They were distracting and prevented readers from enjoying the story. Again, if the majority of readers are not getting an entertaining story or they are getting new, unexpected and inappropriate bits dropped in, they will stop reading. Perhaps writers thought that certain things could be added because they were 'modern' or 'not like the old stuff.' Old is bad for some.\", '', 'The beauty of SF is building interesting worlds and interesting stories that include recent real or predicted scientific achievements and hardware. A magic moment occurs when the writer makes the reader feel that he is in the world created by the writer.', \"Well, I don't subscribe to writing for the larger audience. If you want to sell lots, then yes, but I have read some wonderful sci-fi that is not mass audience and I wouldn't have missed it for the worlds. Some books gain readers gradually, by word of mouth and that is one of the blessings of eBooks and self-pub - the slow grow books are still there for sale, not ended arbitrarily by a publisher. (That said, some publishers support not immediately massive selling books because they like them themselves - Del Ray and Rosemary Kirstein's series being a case in point.)\", '', 'What are the elements that appeared in the 1980s?', '', \"I've been reading sf for a long time and reading older sf and nothing immediately springs to mind for me.\", '', 'When you talk about sf are you primarily concentrating on what is sometimes called hard sf and excluding space opera and military sf?', '', 'I agree that feeling you are in the created world is a magic moment - and some writers manage it, others manage anachronisms that undo my suspension of disbelief. Some of that comes where someone thinks they\\'ve researched something, but don\\'t know the small details and \"feel\" of it in the way that someone who has lived it does. So being inside a military organisation (I haven\\'t unless you count re-enactment) but seeing that the author of some military sf has served is a plus - some people successfully write being inside without having done it but others don\\'t. My particular bete noir is the behaviour of scientists - Hollywood often gets this wrong and some writers base their work on what they \"know\" from TV. I have a particular fondness for Czerneda\\'s Species Imperative series because she gets scientists and research so spot on and writes the most superb aliens.', 'Of course, but I am absolutely sure that you take a book from a shelf, by an unknown author, and just by reading two or three sentences you already know if that writer knows his craft or not, what his style is, well, many things that most do not detect, because surprisingly enough there are still a shocking amount of books printed with spelling mistakes, badly edited or simply no edition, especially from small printers, almost friends stamps.', 'But what I mean is that in your case you are the type of writer who knows what she is doing. What I mean by my observation about computers is that it seems to me that the feeling that anyone can has become general, and yes, they can, but studying, climbing the mountain meter by meter, step by step. Because there is a tendency to think that technology can facilitate it. In fact the discussion of whether an AI or software can write like a professional is already approaching a decade; but can they surpass Faulkner, Shakespeare? Its creators obviously say yes. I have doubts that this is possible.', 'I also worry about those editing software. For kids who are just starting out and who have less and less respect for general literature, my impression is that it will confuse them more instead of helping them. It is very likely that several will go over 100K and are just beginning to wonder what the style, the narrative voice, etc. is, instead of trying to find out first.', 'Because there is already a problem, and it is double (look, with this I know that I give you the can, but we both know that the new ones also read all this, I suppose that that is our responsibility or I at least see it that way), and The problem, as I said, is that THE STYLE MUST BE WORKED.', 'That is basically what sets a writer apart. It is the paint tone. What defines whether it is good or not. If what that girl writes can be sold. Those of the RHM did not care that', 'made a Harry Potter fanfic or that she was sixteen. But she had style. Where they were wrong, yes, it was in that they did not notice that', 'took that story with the plot ready (that is, at the argument level she did not have much to think about) and she wrote the book that she would have liked to read; but her first novel, already hers, proved that she only wrote well and proves that Mondadori is also wrong from time to time.', '', 'Be careful, these are documented cases, but they serve as an example to know that both style and history (or what is tells, my children) are important. But the plot is only a guide, because THE PLOT ALWAYS CHANGES. That be clear, my puppies.', 'The best test is myself: in 2008 I participated in an international science fiction and fantasy novel competition, two weeks were missing for the deadline and with two thirds of the written novel I had a blockage, I did not know how to finish it, I just did not I could think of nothing, and there was a scheme, I knew the line of events to which I had to shape, but the problem was that, the damned style. One as a writer realizes when there are only pages with blocks of text after another and when those blocks are actually transformed into something alive and moving.', 'In short, I spoke with my husband and told him that I was going to the beach house, I turned off the cell phone and spent an afternoon reading the stories that I write from time to time and that I have unpublished. Which meant that they could be used for the novel. With the material of two of them I finished the remaining third. Now, how come I won the contest and passed me to another eighty novels from the United States, England, Spain, Argentina for the p...y? Style. You have to have charm to tell a story. But the plot always changes. It is just a guide.', '', \"Well, making a very rough and regrettable summary and skipping many elements, I could say that the 80's were defined by the explosion of cyberpunk. Forty years later we are not aware of the enormous influence that this had not only in literature, but also in cinema, comics, it actually turned them all upside down. But forty years later, we must also recognize that forums have only really existed for more or less twenty years. Anyway, in general terms what happened was that:\", \"In the 80's one began to be aware that the New wave was the great hope of science fiction, but, either the shotgun fell from us two meters from the duck or we simply missed the shot completely.

I like complex ideas but I also like meeting *people* so I then read more fantasy - it had complex ideas and I found it interesting how much you can build starting with one change - as in magic is real - and fantasy paid more attention to people. Then at some point the chunk of fantasy in the public library turned into romance novels with trimmings, and I returned to sf and found a lot more human warmth had come to more recent books (couldn't tell you which) and then after a few years I wandered back into fantasy reading authors like Hambly and other ones that did humanity, included relationships, but weren't a romance plot.

    "test": "['That does illustrate part of the current problem. I was approached by a visitor at my job who asked: \"Can you tell me why so much science-fiction is so bad?\" I had no good answer for him.', '', 'In the present, there is a tendency to go for quick and easy. However, as our Managing Editor has said, \"Ninety percent of a good book is research.\" Writing fiction means knowing about \\'real world\\' mythology. And not just Greek or Roman. Specific books are bought for specific settings and time periods. Our ME has read hundreds of books. It\\'s not necessary to read everything but having good, solid references is very important.', '', 'In my experience, the writer needs to go beyond what is just in his head to create a three-dimensional world and characters. Established, formal methods of writing exist because they work and every new writer has to start somewhere.', 'What in particular did they think was bad regarding science fiction?', 'There was nothing further that was said. I knew what he was talking about. A few issues are these: Writing to suit perceived trendy topics as opposed to an entertaining story. Science-fiction began to veer away from entertaining the reader in the 1980s. There was one author I liked and this person went on to win an award.', '', \"Another culprit was writing stories that the author wanted to write but which did not sit well with a larger audience. In other words, authors need to know what the average SF reader wants and likes and what they do not like. In the 1980s, elements began to appear in stories that had no business being there. They were distracting and prevented readers from enjoying the story. Again, if the majority of readers are not getting an entertaining story or they are getting new, unexpected and inappropriate bits dropped in, they will stop reading. Perhaps writers thought that certain things could be added because they were 'modern' or 'not like the old stuff.' Old is bad for some.\", '', 'The beauty of SF is building interesting worlds and interesting stories that include recent real or predicted scientific achievements and hardware. A magic moment occurs when the writer makes the reader feel that he is in the world created by the writer.', \"Well, I don't subscribe to writing for the larger audience. If you want to sell lots, then yes, but I have read some wonderful sci-fi that is not mass audience and I wouldn't have missed it for the worlds. Some books gain readers gradually, by word of mouth and that is one of the blessings of eBooks and self-pub - the slow grow books are still there for sale, not ended arbitrarily by a publisher. (That said, some publishers support not immediately massive selling books because they like them themselves - Del Ray and Rosemary Kirstein's series being a case in point.)\", '', 'What are the elements that appeared in the 1980s?', '', \"I've been reading sf for a long time and reading older sf and nothing immediately springs to mind for me.\", '', 'When you talk about sf are you primarily concentrating on what is sometimes called hard sf and excluding space opera and military sf?', '', 'I agree that feeling you are in the created world is a magic moment - and some writers manage it, others manage anachronisms that undo my suspension of disbelief. Some of that comes where someone thinks they\\'ve researched something, but don\\'t know the small details and \"feel\" of it in the way that someone who has lived it does. So being inside a military organisation (I haven\\'t unless you count re-enactment) but seeing that the author of some military sf has served is a plus - some people successfully write being inside without having done it but others don\\'t. My particular bete noir is the behaviour of scientists - Hollywood often gets this wrong and some writers base their work on what they \"know\" from TV. I have a particular fondness for Czerneda\\'s Species Imperative series because she gets scientists and research so spot on and writes the most superb aliens.', 'Of course, but I am absolutely sure that you take a book from a shelf, by an unknown author, and just by reading two or three sentences you already know if that writer knows his craft or not, what his style is, well, many things that most do not detect, because surprisingly enough there are still a shocking amount of books printed with spelling mistakes, badly edited or simply no edition, especially from small printers, almost friends stamps.', 'But what I mean is that in your case you are the type of writer who knows what she is doing. What I mean by my observation about computers is that it seems to me that the feeling that anyone can has become general, and yes, they can, but studying, climbing the mountain meter by meter, step by step. Because there is a tendency to think that technology can facilitate it. In fact the discussion of whether an AI or software can write like a professional is already approaching a decade; but can they surpass Faulkner, Shakespeare? Its creators obviously say yes. I have doubts that this is possible.', 'I also worry about those editing software. For kids who are just starting out and who have less and less respect for general literature, my impression is that it will confuse them more instead of helping them. It is very likely that several will go over 100K and are just beginning to wonder what the style, the narrative voice, etc. is, instead of trying to find out first.', 'Because there is already a problem, and it is double (look, with this I know that I give you the can, but we both know that the new ones also read all this, I suppose that that is our responsibility or I at least see it that way), and The problem, as I said, is that THE STYLE MUST BE WORKED.', 'That is basically what sets a writer apart. It is the paint tone. What defines whether it is good or not. If what that girl writes can be sold. Those of the RHM did not care that', 'made a Harry Potter fanfic or that she was sixteen. But she had style. Where they were wrong, yes, it was in that they did not notice that', 'took that story with the plot ready (that is, at the argument level she did not have much to think about) and she wrote the book that she would have liked to read; but her first novel, already hers, proved that she only wrote well and proves that Mondadori is also wrong from time to time.', '', 'Be careful, these are documented cases, but they serve as an example to know that both style and history (or what is tells, my children) are important. But the plot is only a guide, because THE PLOT ALWAYS CHANGES. That be clear, my puppies.', 'The best test is myself: in 2008 I participated in an international science fiction and fantasy novel competition, two weeks were missing for the deadline and with two thirds of the written novel I had a blockage, I did not know how to finish it, I just did not I could think of nothing, and there was a scheme, I knew the line of events to which I had to shape, but the problem was that, the damned style. One as a writer realizes when there are only pages with blocks of text after another and when those blocks are actually transformed into something alive and moving.', 'In short, I spoke with my husband and told him that I was going to the beach house, I turned off the cell phone and spent an afternoon reading the stories that I write from time to time and that I have unpublished. Which meant that they could be used for the novel. With the material of two of them I finished the remaining third. Now, how come I won the contest and passed me to another eighty novels from the United States, England, Spain, Argentina for the p...y? Style. You have to have charm to tell a story.

My particular bete noir is the behaviour of scientists - Hollywood often gets this wrong and some writers base their work on what they \"know\" from TV. I have a particular fondness for Czerneda\\'s Species Imperative series because she gets scientists and research so spot on and writes the most superb aliens.', 'Of course, but I am absolutely sure that you take a book from a shelf, by an unknown author, and just by reading two or three sentences you already know if that writer knows his craft or not, what his style is, well, many things that most do not detect, because surprisingly enough there are still a shocking amount of books printed with spelling mistakes, badly edited or simply no edition, especially from small printers, almost friends stamps.', 'But what I mean is that in your case you are the type of writer who knows what she is doing. What I mean by my observation about computers is that it seems to me that the feeling that anyone can has become general, and yes, they can, but studying, climbing the mountain meter by meter, step by step. Because there is a tendency to think that technology can facilitate it. In fact the discussion of whether an AI or software can write like a professional is already approaching a decade; but can they surpass Faulkner, Shakespeare? Its creators obviously say yes. I have doubts that this is possible.', 'I also worry about those editing software. For kids who are just starting out and who have less and less respect for general literature, my impression is that it will confuse them more instead of helping them. It is very likely that several will go over 100K and are just beginning to wonder what the style, the narrative voice, etc. is, instead of trying to find out first.', 'Because there is already a problem, and it is double (look, with this I know that I give you the can, but we both know that the new ones also read all this, I suppose that that is our responsibility or I at least see it that way), and The problem, as I said, is that THE STYLE MUST BE WORKED.', 'That is basically what sets a writer apart. It is the paint tone. What defines whether it is good or not. If what that girl writes can be sold. Those of the RHM did not care that', 'made a Harry Potter fanfic or that she was sixteen.

But the plot is only a guide, because THE PLOT ALWAYS CHANGES. That be clear, my puppies.', 'The best test is myself: in 2008 I participated in an international science fiction and fantasy novel competition, two weeks were missing for the deadline and with two thirds of the written novel I had a blockage, I did not know how to finish it, I just did not I could think of nothing, and there was a scheme, I knew the line of events to which I had to shape, but the problem was that, the damned style. One as a writer realizes when there are only pages with blocks of text after another and when those blocks are actually transformed into something alive and moving.', 'In short, I spoke with my husband and told him that I was going to the beach house, I turned off the cell phone and spent an afternoon reading the stories that I write from time to time and that I have unpublished. Which meant that they could be used for the novel. With the material of two of them I finished the remaining third. Now, how come I won the contest and passed me to another eighty novels from the United States, England, Spain, Argentina for the p...y? Style. You have to have charm to tell a story. But the plot always changes. It is just a guide.', '', \"Well, making a very rough and regrettable summary and skipping many elements, I could say that the 80's were defined by the explosion of cyberpunk. Forty years later we are not aware of the enormous influence that this had not only in literature, but also in cinema, comics, it actually turned them all upside down. But forty years later, we must also recognize that forums have only really existed for more or less twenty years. Anyway, in general terms what happened was that:\", \"In the 80's one began to be aware that the New wave was the great hope of science fiction, but, either the shotgun fell from us two meters from the duck or we simply missed the shot completely. And when there was a serious, almost academic intention to amend the course, when there seemed to be an awareness that the science fiction writer must be someone who should know literature first, then cyberpunk appears and ends up sending everything to hell. It frivolized literature.\", 'The counter-answer, moreover, came from the hand of the cinema. The phenomena of Star Wars and Aliens already put the tombstone to the genre or at least they left the following that began to write science fiction very limited or in a condition of dependency: the writer from then on is more aware than there is on screen than from the books he reads, literature begins to become audiovisual.', 'Those who woken up were the academic specialists in prospective literature, but the analysis is recent, the cases of novels such as', \", etc., showed that non-science fiction authors write works of the called mainstream for several years in a row they start taking all the Hugo and Nebula awards. But it shows the initial analysis of the 80's: Philip Roth, Michael Chabon, that they are NOT science fiction writers, obviously touch on topics that have been written a thousand times by other writers of the genre, actually in the pulp, with a treatment that at most can be considered acceptable, because they repeat all the topics of genre. The difference is that they do it very, very well, with style.\", 'And we? Now that the science fiction writer is more concerned with rendering, on his computer there is always something downloading; now that the obsession of the best-selling writers, with which they drag everyone, is to write works whose only goal is go to the screen (and, by the way, Netflix is tearing them all to pieces about the current crisis of screenwriters, it has been turned into an orange juicer), which produces an absolute contempt for the calm, reflective paragraph, which was so enjoyed before, and the only objective is the worship of dialogue, everything should be dialogue, perhaps instead of writing novels better we dedicate to immediately make only scripts, hail Netflix,  I see it a bit difficult, unless we become aware that, before starting to write science fiction, fantasy, whatever, first we must learn to write well.', \"What we do is literature, in case someone still doesn't find out.\", 'Cyberpunk? Neuromancer? Seriously? Again, I\\'m seeing strange things here. Star Wars? To be American for a moment: \"C\\'mon folks. Are yuh bein\\' mind controlled?\"', '', 'A book is a combination of things, all working in harmony. Plot, dialogue... Everything. All of those elements work together to tell the story.', '', \"Netflix? A non-entity. It doesn't matter. By the way, they prefer to buy all rights. Have a lawyer handy.\", '', 'Finally, style. Style develops by itself unless you want to slavishly copy someone else. Your choices for subjects, settings, character types and word choices, are made subconsciously.', '', 'Literature is always literature. You don\\'t have to write Stars Wars type books. There is no requirement. I watch very little. It doesn\\'t matter that I have 200 channels, only a handful of things interest me. Only a handful of things are worth watching. I regard \"commentary\" TV as being obsessed with trivia.', \"No one can argue with that. Doesn't matter at all what process you use to get there, that's exactly the goal.\", 'Oh by the way, I forgot about Blade Runner and to a lesser extent Dune. They also had an influence, although less, I would say more in the underground sector of fandom. In any case, the question will always remain of how history would have been if the Dune planned by Moebius and Jodorowsky had prospered. It occurs to me that a kind of The fifth Element but well done and without Bruce Willis.', 'Whereas I am moved to say \"Dude, what planet are you from?\"', '', \"You clearly have some very firm, not to say rigid, ideas of what science fiction should be, but although you write beautiful prose, you are very opaque in what you are trying to say - you've not given any clear examples of what you consider to be good science fiction, just wait until someone mentions a book or sub-genre and are disparaging about it. This may not be an intentional policy on your part, but it is not conducive to an interesting debate. We all like science fiction and/or fantasy on this forum, we have a very wide range of preferences - no-one likes everything. We do also like to have an interesting debate, with arguments and data supporting the initial statements. You have said some interesting things, but I am still no clearer as to examples you consider to be good sf. Perhaps you could list some examples in the next post?\", 'May I just point out that the only real SF is hard SF, all punk rock made after 1979 is fake, and only the things that I like are objectively good.', 'Real punk died in 1978.', '', \"Punk in '79, Pah. Lightweight.\", 'Is that really true? I can teach any suitably motivated individual to write. Formal writing approaches exist because they work. It appears some people think \\'any way is the right way.\\' I find the anything goes approach lacking the necessary structure to help any writer. I have had lengthy conversations with writers about this. They want guidance not \"do whatever.\"', 'Here they are. Waldo & Magic Inc. by Heinlein. A simple story about a device that can help someone when used in space. I really prefer such stories since they combine the human and technology elements so well. Magic Inc. is a remarkable take on the use of magic in everyday life.', '', 'Rendezvous with Rama by Clarke. Though not without a few flaws, such as how this ship is fueled, a really interesting, and plausible story.', '', 'The Caves of Steel (1972 cover) by Asimov. A remarkably compelling title and evocative cover image. These two elements were just riveting when I first saw the book, and then there was the actual book.', '', 'I also read some of the Perry Rhodan books but tired of them because they were not as complex as they could have been. But according to Wikipedia \"... it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written.\"', '', 'I prefer hardware stories that are plausible, and space opera.', \"If you had written the edited version above, I'd agree with you. However, the fact is, that there is more than one way to skin a cat. Different people respond to different methods. Formal methods do work, but not for everyone.\", '', 'And, to bring this into line with the original post, I think there are many ways to write a book. Some will work better throwing words and ideas onto a page, then tidying them at a later point. Others can methodically plan out a structure and then create from that. Still others work from a hybrid method, or something completely different.', '', \"There is no infallible rule book to follow, just as there is no perfect book (science fiction or otherwise) for all. If there was, we'd all be stuck in a simulacrum of the 1950s reading the same old stuff, from the same old boys' club, and being bored as hell.\", \"I can't tell you how much I relate to this lol, I've been putting off writing my fantasy series for so long and I'm just getting into it now.\", \"Writing an entire novel is very difficult and even though it's your story some scenes and events aren't as fun to write as others, writing out events as they pop into your head is a great idea! Just because you're writing a story doesn't mean the begging writing process has to be in order but the way I see it is that if you don't push yourself to write the parts you're not too thrilled about now then you never will lol.\", 'But write how you want to write, there is no correct way to do it.', 'To stay on track with my story and keep a general idea of what I want to happen is I just do a very small summary on a separate document or paper, it really helps to keep you grounded with your original idea for the book.', 'Well, I hope this helps, good luck with your novel!', 'As I suspected, the shadow of the 1950s. The cause of great dread - and endless bad comments from some. I wish this obsessive-compulsive disorder regarding the 1950s would end.', '', 'No infallible rule book to follow. Well, if writing was like mathematics, no. But I think beginning writers need something to hang their hats on to start. A bit of structure. As a famous illustrator personally told me, \"You need to find out how it really works before you can distort it [well].\"', '', 'I read to be entertained. In the case of SF, the right blend of the amazing and the right mix of characters never gets old. Around the mid-1980s, across all entertainment genres, \"mature\" material began to be added. But Mature was the wrong word. A fake word. What Mature actually meant was adding a few sexual situations. In the case of SF, nothing graphic but in one case: \"He grabbed her behind.\" The word \"behind\" was not used but its vulgar substitute. It was the means to activate a device. However, it violated one of the standards of good SF. By 1987, George Michael was yelling \"I want your sex\" on the radio. Some radio stations refused to play it. If anyone thinks that\\'s \"progress,\" I would say adding the vulgar was a step back, followed by additional steps back in following years.', 'I read to be entertained, as well.

I have a particular fondness for Czerneda\\'s Species Imperative series because she gets scientists and research so spot on and writes the most superb aliens.', 'Of course, but I am absolutely sure that you take a book from a shelf, by an unknown author, and just by reading two or three sentences you already know if that writer knows his craft or not, what his style is, well, many things that most do not detect, because surprisingly enough there are still a shocking amount of books printed with spelling mistakes, badly edited or simply no edition, especially from small printers, almost friends stamps.', 'But what I mean is that in your case you are the type of writer who knows what she is doing. What I mean by my observation about computers is that it seems to me that the feeling that anyone can has become general, and yes, they can, but studying, climbing the mountain meter by meter, step by step. Because there is a tendency to think that technology can facilitate it. In fact the discussion of whether an AI or software can write like a professional is already approaching a decade; but can they surpass Faulkner, Shakespeare? Its creators obviously say yes. I have doubts that this is possible.', 'I also worry about those editing software. For kids who are just starting out and who have less and less respect for general literature, my impression is that it will confuse them more instead of helping them. It is very likely that several will go over 100K and are just beginning to wonder what the style, the narrative voice, etc. is, instead of trying to find out first.', 'Because there is already a problem, and it is double (look, with this I know that I give you the can, but we both know that the new ones also read all this, I suppose that that is our responsibility or I at least see it that way), and The problem, as I said, is that THE STYLE MUST BE WORKED.', 'That is basically what sets a writer apart. It is the paint tone. What defines whether it is good or not. If what that girl writes can be sold. Those of the RHM did not care that', 'made a Harry Potter fanfic or that she was sixteen. But she had style. Where they were wrong, yes, it was in that they did not notice that', 'took that story with the plot ready (that is, at the argument level she did not have much to think about) and she wrote the book that she would have liked to read; but her first novel, already hers, proved that she only wrote well and proves that Mondadori is also wrong from time to time.', '', 'Be careful, these are documented cases, but they serve as an example to know that both style and history (or what is tells, my children) are important. But the plot is only a guide, because THE PLOT ALWAYS CHANGES. That be clear, my puppies.', 'The best test is myself: in 2008 I participated in an international science fiction and fantasy novel competition, two weeks were missing for the deadline and with two thirds of the written novel I had a blockage, I did not know how to finish it, I just did not I could think of nothing, and there was a scheme, I knew the line of events to which I had to shape, but the problem was that, the damned style. One as a writer realizes when there are only pages with blocks of text after another and when those blocks are actually transformed into something alive and moving.', 'In short, I spoke with my husband and told him that I was going to the beach house, I turned off the cell phone and spent an afternoon reading the stories that I write from time to time and that I have unpublished. Which meant that they could be used for the novel. With the material of two of them I finished the remaining third. Now, how come I won the contest and passed me to another eighty novels from the United States, England, Spain, Argentina for the p...y? Style. You have to have charm to tell a story. But the plot always changes. It is just a guide.', '', \"Well, making a very rough and regrettable summary and skipping many elements, I could say that the 80's were defined by the explosion of cyberpunk. Forty years later we are not aware of the enormous influence that this had not only in literature, but also in cinema, comics, it actually turned them all upside down. But forty years later, we must also recognize that forums have only really existed for more or less twenty years. Anyway, in general terms what happened was that:\", \"In the 80's one began to be aware that the New wave was the great hope of science fiction, but, either the shotgun fell from us two meters from the duck or we simply missed the shot completely. And when there was a serious, almost academic intention to amend the course, when there seemed to be an awareness that the science fiction writer must be someone who should know literature first, then cyberpunk appears and ends up sending everything to hell. It frivolized literature.\", 'The counter-answer, moreover, came from the hand of the cinema. The phenomena of Star Wars and Aliens already put the tombstone to the genre or at least they left the following that began to write science fiction very limited or in a condition of dependency: the writer from then on is more aware than there is on screen than from the books he reads, literature begins to become audiovisual.', 'Those who woken up were the academic specialists in prospective literature, but the analysis is recent, the cases of novels such as', \", etc., showed that non-science fiction authors write works of the called mainstream for several years in a row they start taking all the Hugo and Nebula awards. But it shows the initial analysis of the 80's: Philip Roth, Michael Chabon, that they are NOT science fiction writers, obviously touch on topics that have been written a thousand times by other writers of the genre, actually in the pulp, with a treatment that at most can be considered acceptable, because they repeat all the topics of genre. The difference is that they do it very, very well, with style.\", 'And we? Now that the science fiction writer is more concerned with rendering, on his computer there is always something downloading; now that the obsession of the best-selling writers, with which they drag everyone, is to write works whose only goal is go to the screen (and, by the way, Netflix is tearing them all to pieces about the current crisis of screenwriters, it has been turned into an orange juicer), which produces an absolute contempt for the calm, reflective paragraph, which was so enjoyed before, and the only objective is the worship of dialogue, everything should be dialogue, perhaps instead of writing novels better we dedicate to immediately make only scripts, hail Netflix,  I see it a bit difficult, unless we become aware that, before starting to write science fiction, fantasy, whatever, first we must learn to write well.', \"What we do is literature, in case someone still doesn't find out.\", 'Cyberpunk? Neuromancer? Seriously? Again, I\\'m seeing strange things here. Star Wars? To be American for a moment: \"C\\'mon folks. Are yuh bein\\' mind controlled?\"', '', 'A book is a combination of things, all working in harmony. Plot, dialogue... Everything. All of those elements work together to tell the story.', '', \"Netflix? A non-entity. It doesn't matter. By the way, they prefer to buy all rights. Have a lawyer handy.\", '', 'Finally, style. Style develops by itself unless you want to slavishly copy someone else. Your choices for subjects, settings, character types and word choices, are made subconsciously.', '', 'Literature is always literature. You don\\'t have to write Stars Wars type books. There is no requirement. I watch very little. It doesn\\'t matter that I have 200 channels, only a handful of things interest me. Only a handful of things are worth watching. I regard \"commentary\" TV as being obsessed with trivia.', \"No one can argue with that. Doesn't matter at all what process you use to get there, that's exactly the goal.\", 'Oh by the way, I forgot about Blade Runner and to a lesser extent Dune. They also had an influence, although less, I would say more in the underground sector of fandom. In any case, the question will always remain of how history would have been if the Dune planned by Moebius and Jodorowsky had prospered. It occurs to me that a kind of The fifth Element but well done and without Bruce Willis.', 'Whereas I am moved to say \"Dude, what planet are you from?\"', '', \"You clearly have some very firm, not to say rigid, ideas of what science fiction should be, but although you write beautiful prose, you are very opaque in what you are trying to say - you've not given any clear examples of what you consider to be good science fiction, just wait until someone mentions a book or sub-genre and are disparaging about it. This may not be an intentional policy on your part, but it is not conducive to an interesting debate. We all like science fiction and/or fantasy on this forum, we have a very wide range of preferences - no-one likes everything. We do also like to have an interesting debate, with arguments and data supporting the initial statements. You have said some interesting things, but I am still no clearer as to examples you consider to be good sf. Perhaps you could list some examples in the next post?\", 'May I just point out that the only real SF is hard SF, all punk rock made after 1979 is fake, and only the things that I like are objectively good.', 'Real punk died in 1978.', '', \"Punk in '79, Pah. Lightweight.\", 'Is that really true? I can teach any suitably motivated individual to write. Formal writing approaches exist because they work. It appears some people think \\'any way is the right way.\\' I find the anything goes approach lacking the necessary structure to help any writer. I have had lengthy conversations with writers about this. They want guidance not \"do whatever.\"', 'Here they are. Waldo & Magic Inc. by Heinlein. A simple story about a device that can help someone when used in space. I really prefer such stories since they combine the human and technology elements so well. Magic Inc. is a remarkable take on the use of magic in everyday life.', '', 'Rendezvous with Rama by Clarke. Though not without a few flaws, such as how this ship is fueled, a really interesting, and plausible story.', '', 'The Caves of Steel (1972 cover) by Asimov. A remarkably compelling title and evocative cover image. These two elements were just riveting when I first saw the book, and then there was the actual book.', '', 'I also read some of the Perry Rhodan books but tired of them because they were not as complex as they could have been. But according to Wikipedia \"... it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written.\"', '', 'I prefer hardware stories that are plausible, and space opera.', \"If you had written the edited version above, I'd agree with you. However, the fact is, that there is more than one way to skin a cat. Different people respond to different methods. Formal methods do work, but not for everyone.\", '', 'And, to bring this into line with the original post, I think there are many ways to write a book. Some will work better throwing words and ideas onto a page, then tidying them at a later point. Others can methodically plan out a structure and then create from that. Still others work from a hybrid method, or something completely different.', '', \"There is no infallible rule book to follow, just as there is no perfect book (science fiction or otherwise) for all.

In the case of SF, the right blend of the amazing and the right mix of characters never gets old. Around the mid-1980s, across all entertainment genres, \"mature\" material began to be added. But Mature was the wrong word. A fake word. What Mature actually meant was adding a few sexual situations. In the case of SF, nothing graphic but in one case: \"He grabbed her behind.\" The word \"behind\" was not used but its vulgar substitute. It was the means to activate a device. However, it violated one of the standards of good SF. By 1987, George Michael was yelling \"I want your sex\" on the radio. Some radio stations refused to play it. If anyone thinks that\\'s \"progress,\" I would say adding the vulgar was a step back, followed by additional steps back in following years.', 'I read to be entertained, as well. You are correct, the right blend of the amazing and the right mix of characters never gets old. But, our tastes are, I suspect, different.', '', 'You think writers in the early stages of their careers need a bit of structure. I agree. However, my point was that there is more than one form of structure available, and there are different ways of both teaching, and learning. Hence, there is no infallible methodology.', '', \"As to mature content (and I'm being careful here not to overstep the forum rules of current affairs etc.), your definition of vulgarity may or may not correspond to mine. As social commentary has been a large element of sci-fi* for many decades (including\", ',', ', and', \") I'm unconvinced that it should not reference sexual matters, as well, within the context of the story.

If they didn't, they would not have further books published. But, they all vary in their content. So it goes in learning. Some learn better by being told, others learn better by doing. Some cut their teeth on fan fiction, and many playground games are just fan fiction with kids creating stories with themselves playing characters from the TV programme they saw the evening before, or the tales told by their grandda around the hearth, in times past.\", '', \"Right. I'm away to bed. It's late here. I promise not to set my phone to play George Michael to wake me up in the morning. Or, do I?\", '', '*Yes, I like many others, use sci-fi as a catch all. Science fiction, sf, sci-fi, all good.', \"I was talking about the final product; hopefully (for me) a coherent, well-written and engaging novel. Any way an individual writer chooses or finds to achieve this is the right way for them, whether through formal education and/or established techniques, or by 'winging it' by the seat of their pants. The final product is all that matters, and your 'do whatever' means a writer does whatever it takes to reach that target, whether through formal or informal means and methods.\", '', 'I have had two novels traditionally published and started both of them with a rough idea in my head; a beginning, a few set-piece scenes and an ending to write towards. When I typed the first words I had no idea who the characters were, what POV I would use or how I was going to get from the beginning to the first set-piece (a scene in my first novel that began 80 pages in). But it worked out fine and I won an award for that novel before I got the book deal. I was also nominated for a prestigious screenwriting prize for an animated screenplay I wrote, which I started with a one sentence idea (', \"). That's all I had when I sat down to write. (I nearly sold that script to Fox, but that's another story!)\", '', \"I'm not telling you this to brag - though I am extremely pleased with myself, as failed high school English student with no formal writing education, to have taught myself from scratch to write creatively and achieve modest success - but just to demonstrate there is no rigid path to reach your goals.

I like a good discussion.', \"In terms of physical relations, not bothered either way though I have some limits - I am sometimes moved to flick pages - oh, still at it, any important dialogue in between action, no - flick. Some is well done, some isn't.\", \"I've read quite a lot of Heinlein, though not recently, Citizen of the Galaxy being my favourite. Never read the two you are mentioning, I'll look out for them.\", \"Heard of the Clarke but not read it - I'll go looking for it.\", \"Asimov - know the name very well, not sure if I've read his or not - I did read both SF and fantasy in my teens but found some SF authors back then very dry - it was all complex ideas and no warmth to the characters. I think Niven was one - I read Ringworld and I have the images in my mind still - but the people I could take or leave. I like complex ideas but I also like meeting *people* so I then read more fantasy - it had complex ideas and I found it interesting how much you can build starting with one change - as in magic is real - and fantasy paid more attention to people. Then at some point the chunk of fantasy in the public library turned into romance novels with trimmings, and I returned to sf and found a lot more human warmth had come to more recent books (couldn't tell you which) and then after a few years I wandered back into fantasy reading authors like Hambly and other ones that did humanity, included relationships, but weren't a romance plot. It is frustrating though, when you feel like reading (sf or fantasy) and nothing is quite what you are looking for.\", 'Perry Rhodan - never even heard of him', \". I find that a bit - people on here talk about books that are stunningly well known and I've never heard of them. Took me until A Civil Campaign to hear of Lois McMaster Bujold, now one of my favourite authors (though she wasn't much published in the UK and it was the internet that has widened things).\", 'In terms of being pubbed/self pub it gives me both hope and depression to know how many really well known authors I take years to hear of - hope because hey the word gets out eventually, and depression because of the length of eventually.']"

Despite the quality of some of the writing, I found it frustrating at times, because so many of the stories are just ten pages or less. For me the ideal length of a short story is 18 to 28 pages, and there are only five stories here that are fifteen pages or longer.

Before starting this, I read his WikiPedia and it noted that he suffered from alcoholism. Partly because of this, I think, I was aware of the extreme amount of drinking that his characters did in this story. I still enjoy his work and having re-read four of his novels within the span of a month, I started to recognize some patterns he used. Next up will probably be another re-read -- I am on a personal moratorium on new books until I can cull my existing set, which were at one time stacked three deep on shelves.', 'Agree this applies to a lot of YA fiction, but I  would hesitate to generalise.

Mura’s Star…a sudden star…appeared in the sky, pouring out energy in a white glare, bathing earth in deadly light, changing life in a thousand subtle ways.”', '', 'Well, maybe not so subtle. Mura’s Star is an astronomical anomaly wielding a mysterious power causing an insanity that ends in death and civilization to falter and plunge into decay. Or does it? There are those, usually the more educated, who believe The Sudden Star has no influence at all on the flattening of society and its civilized values. The Author lets the reader decide. Personally, the sf fan in me wishes she had affirmed it one way or the other but I’ll survive. Pamela Sargent is an arresting storyteller. Her world is a shattered landscape in all directions, ugly, violent and corrupt but not completely beyond hope. There are those struggling against insurmountable odds to improve more than just their immediate lot but mostly the prospect for an improved quality of life is bleak and usually ends in death.

A while back, I picked up three Dune prequels for my kindle (99 pence each). They were Sisterhood Of Dune, Mentats Of Dune and Navigators of Dune.

I have a Kindle Fire tablet which I use sitting by a table or counter, and sometimes in my easy chair. If I'm going out and about I have a Kindle White Paper which fits easily in my pocket. I sometimes read off my phone but I do not like the little screen. If I read outside, I always use the White Paper. I find it easier to read than either a book or a tablet.\", '', 'There are a couple of downsides with the tablet. One (my main problem) there are too many other things to read on it. I subscribe to the Atlantic and the Washington Post via the tablet, and my email is accessible from the tablet and I can get lost in my New York Times from there as well. (About a year ago, the New York Times stopped supporting the Kindle Fire through the app store, and now you click through via an email from them.)  And since it is multi-functional I might get distracted by games or other apps as well. Two, it is not as heavy as a hard cover book, and it certainly more manageable in terms of losing your place etc. but it is noticeable that you have something in your hands (I have the 10 in. screen, quite large), much more so than the White Paper. If I could only have one reader it would be the tablet. But the weight and the outside ease of reading makes the White Paper a very handy device.', \"I finished Geraldine Brooks's\", \"this past weekend. It's an ambitious, continent- and time-spanning book that suffers from a lack of depth or nuance — it felt a bit like all the research had been done on Wikipedia (harsh, perhaps). Especially in comparison to Rachel Kaddish (\", \", another time- and continent-spanning story about the history of Jewish thought and written artifacts) Brooks's storytelling is a bit lazy and the characters flat. The author has, I think, also some problematic racial biases (a mixed race scientist who is heavily sexualized, a Black cab driver whose cab smells of “ganja”, that the only characters whose accents are written out are Black). Would not recommend.\", 'Finished Mr.PARADISE By Elmore Leonard.', 'Started FEAR NOTHING by Dean Koontz.', 'A good book, followed by a good sequel, a pity he never finished the trilogy', 'Many thanks', \"that's very helpful.  And thank you for explaining in some detail.   I'll be putting these options into action should my reading needs change.  I've had a Kindle Paperwhite for years but have read less than ten books on it and only really use it for quick checking of emails.  I can see how the Kindle Fire tablet would work better around the house and the Paperwhite for back up when out and about.\", \"My reasons for not using the Kindle have not been about prejudice but simply that much of my reading is cheap paperbacks that compare very well for price with those available on Kindle (plus I like the nostalgic feel). I read very very little current fiction.  And the more expensive books that I buy are usually relatively specialist that I can resell fairly easily on Amazon (or used to until March last year), something that I don't think is possible with Kindle purchases.\", \"I'll definitely bear the Kindle Fire in mind as a future possibility.  We're fairly low key here with our technology: we share a laptop and an ipad, though my wife also owns a smartphone.\", \"You are quite correct; eBooks cannot be resold. They are only a licence to read, issued to the individual (well the individual's registered readers actually). Without doing some legally grey stuff to remove the DRM they wouldn't be readable on the buyers reader anyway.\"]"

It had already happened. The world had gone through the Nuclear Armageddon and humanity survived. Only to progress heavily towards the next evolutionary step through the cybernetics.', '', \"The Major became a full cyborg, with little humanity left in her shell. The armour she's wearing, meaning that the title has multiple meaning and the traditional AI angle were swooped out of the picture.

The endless war that became known as the sustainable war broke everything. The normal people mostly cannot grasp the nature of the digital world.

What is interesting is that there is no technological singularity.', '', \"The AI's haven't become overlords, and a lot of them shows emotions that render them incapable of preventing certain things from happening, where as in the singularity that would not happen. All the most prominent ghosts are therefore humans. Not machines or artificial intelligences. Although in this latest iteration that might not be the case. In fact, what is happening in their world is close to magic and that makes you wonder how?\", '', 'It stuns you and you become perplexed by the magic, because there is no way to explain the physical manifestations. The faceless people that nobody can see. The augmented humans that are able to dodge bullets unnaturally. And then there is the disappearances that are close to abductions and cannot be explained, even though the invisibility is a real and explained thing in the world.', '', \"I really like that the production team didn't push the reset button, but instead pushed the boundaries real hard while retaining that Hard SF angle, mixed with in a cyberpunkish dark future. What I miss is the world that was shown in the first movie. The city that really felt like alive and real in every portion. To me, that city and imaginary felt closest to the famous BladeRunner's Los Angeles.\", '', 'Funny as it is the Japanese never has ventured into that world. To show world ruined by pollution and weather change. The world in transition as the humanity pushes to the stars and \"offworld locations\" in the exoplanets. In a way I have thought for a while that their world is closest to Altered Carbon universe. Except they don\\'t need stacks, because the soul can be digitised, its memories stored, and the old meat sack disposed or replaced by a fully cybernetic body.', '', \"So, you see, there are a lot of things that goes in this series and it is only sad that Netflix hasn't shown all of the previous SAC to let people a full understanding on this epic series. I wonder where it is heading and what we are going to see in the future.

Realistically, I think the production team just wanted to assemble the backgrounds from stock assets they could get off turbosquid, lol.\", '', 'As much as I disliked the production style in 2045, the story did pull me in and by the last episode it felt good to be back in SAC territory, I wish they had produced it in 2D rather than looking like a PS2 cut scene, and I suspect this might have put some people off.']"

But even the issue of jobs can be put to one side until you've actually started writing these characters and found out who they really are as opposed to automata confined within the strange identities you've picked for them.

This is Robinson's take on generational ships, and humanity's dream to travel to and colonise worlds outside our solar system. This is, as ever with Robinson, 'hard SF' and he pulls no punches when it comes to outlining the problems that would be faced with such ventures. It's hard to say too much about the plot without spoiling the story for new readers, but suffice to say, he's not positive about the chances it will ever really be possible. However, this is ultimately a cry for us to preserve what we have - an argument that Earth is perfect for us, and nowhere else will be. As well as clearly outlining our need to properly appreciate Earth, and not rely on unlikely dreams of living elsewhere as a last resort to climate change and overpopulation, this book has many other qualities. The greatest of these is undoubtedly the development of the consciousness and 'voice' of the book's main narrator: the ship itself. This is quite possibly the best story arc and emotionally-charged representation of an artificial intelligence yet written in SF.  So, this is recommended. That said, its likely to be one that splits readers - some won't like it that Robinson so effectively dismantles the SF dream of space travel, and its seriousness and message can appear coldly rendered at times. This is not exactly escapist literature (which is one reason many of us love SF), though it is very good literature, and is a compelling read.

They had enormous wealth and political power (often subordinate to the Emperor only in theory) by virtue of their hereditary landholdings. Samurai were supposed to be fanatically loyal to their daimyo (again, in theory but they also often were in practice). A samurai without a daimyo master was called a ronin and this was considered a fairly disgraceful position to be in (research the story of the 47 ronin if you don't know it already).

In the Tokugawa era—a much more peaceful period—they were obligated to carry two swords, even in the bathroom, because that was the Law. They served the shogun, and the shogun said that every samurai must carry two swords. In the far future, as our colleague said, they could be servants of megacorporations.

Then science fiction produced a reaction / dystopias of what could go wrong in computing and the movement became known as Cyberpunk - think Terminator, Neuromancer etc. After a brief flourish that movement died back in terms of fictional output when it was realised computers were under control and useful (and boy did the reading public get that wrong - but that is another story).\", '', 'Computers have since become more capable in both capacity and speed.

Certainly the Muderbot series has already earned that accolade.', '', \"But if are looking for what is coming next in AI, I think you will be disappointed. I've summarised the history of AI above to throw up the point that science fiction is always playing catch-up with real world themes. There is one notable exception - Asimov's laws of robotics way back in the middle of the last century. Yes, research is getting interesting results at the moment. No, the tech firms are not publicising what they are coming with until it gets to market - they are in the business of making money after all. And no, I've not seen this new research seriously applied to science fiction themes yet.

The protaganists are flawed, but somehow their moral compass is something the reader can use to navigate the dimness of the usually brutal settings of these types of books. I also think that dark humour is essential to a good grimdark tale. Otherwise it is too depressing and 'off-balance' for the reader.

Below is a part of what I've come up with so far. It was written with the idea that it would be the very beginning of the story.\", '', \"Obviously I don't really know if any of this would end up in whatever I end up with, but since it's my first attempt I'd really appreciate any feedback on general style. Do I seem to be approaching it right? Does it read OK? The big challenge that I see so far is dropping world-building into scenes - have I managed that do you think? Basically any comments at all appreciated (I'm fine with criticism, so please don't hold back!)\", '', 'Thanks a lot!', '', '-------------------------', '', 'Saa stood still, leaning against the south trunk of the half-grown hut. Patrols didn’t usually continue this late into the evening; she had been caught off guard. Not that she had anything to hide - she had been keeping her head down for weeks - and there was no rule that forbade her from being out at this time. But neither did she have a good reason to give for being this far from the center, and Twig and Annfore would never forgive her if soldiers started sniffing around the old forest because she was seen wandering nearby.', '', 'She leant her head against the young wood and closed her eyes, taking in the fresh, green smell, feeling the life pulsing through the thin, papery bark. She just had to wait. They’d be gone soon enough.', '', 'Their voices, low, gravelly and crude, grew louder. They obviously weren’t looking for anyone in particular, or they’d at least be trying to be stealthy - just showing a presence, then; just there to scare people into their homes. Their footsteps stopped at the other side of the hut, the structure creaking as one of the soldiers leaned against it. The harsh, dead smell of tobacco wafted towards her.', '', 'Saa waited, cramp working its way up her back from standing so still. Time passed slowly, like thick, viscous sap, Saa some insect trapped as it congealed around her. The puff-puffing of the soldier’s pipe filled her ears, the sound carrying across the space between them in the still, silent evening air. Scuffing as one of them kicked at the dirt and the roots of the hut. The pipe was re-filled; the scuffing continued. Dusk faded completely, the low moon becoming the only source of light. Still she waited.', '', 'Eventually, one of the soldiers laughed, the kind of harsh guffaw that can only be at somebody’s expense. He muttered something, and the second soldier chuckled. Then a gruff yawn, another creak in the structure of the young hut, and footsteps, heading away to the west, away from the forest edge and back towards the center of town.', '', 'Saa waited until she was sure the soldiers were well out of sight before emerging into the moonlight and dashing across the path into the forest. It welcomed her like a daughter. The enormous trees surrounding her--decades dead, still bearing the scars of sickness--were abuzz with life, decay feeding into youth, rot sustaining abundance. They towered around her, disappearing into the darkness above. Saa breathed it all in, the rich, humid air, the warmth of the mulch beneath her feet, the energy singing around her as nature made new life from the death of the old. She let it wash over her, cleanse her of the grime of the factory and the unlife of the day’s work.', '', 'She walked deeper into the forest, lighting her mini lamp only when it was really too dark to see. After a time, she stopped at the foot of a massive, gnarled trunk. On its north side was a long hole in the bark, about half as tall as she was. She knelt and placed her hands on the woody flesh beneath. Slowly, the wood began to separate from the bark, and then continued to shrink until eventually only a short, thin sapling stood in the middle of the giant, hollow carcass of the ancient tree.', '', 'Saa ducked through the hole, turned, and squatted over the sapling, hands on its topmost branches. The sapling began to broaden and grow, until it lifted Saa clean off the ground and up, through the skeletal tunnel above.', '', 'A few seconds later, Saa emerged into a large, familiar room.', '', '“You’re late, Saa. Been out chasing girls again?” called Twig from his favourite spot, nestled in a wide hammock formed from the interlaced branches of two of the young trees surrounding them.', '', '“Patrols, running even later than yesterday. Had to wait for them to clear off. Any idea what they’re so twitchy about?”', '', 'Twig hung his head over the side of his hammock, a smug look on his face. “I might have an inkling”', '', '', 'The room--their hideout, Saa’s home from home--was cluttered, bits of half-finished projects piled on almost every available surface. The walls were formed from six young trees, each growing from a different branch of the skeleton whose trunk she had just ascended. The young trees, clean and bright, untarnished by the sickly spots that covered those below, leaned slightly inwards, so that they almost met in the middle forty feet above. Platforms like the one Twig was lounging in criss-crossed between the trees at different heights, some forming small worktables, some connecting almost all of the six trees to form upper stories, and one right at the top forming a roof. Long, vertical branches descended from the upper platforms to form ladders, short stubby nobbles acting as rungs on either side.', '', '“I take it the troops are out looking for all their dirty dishes and greasy foodsacks, then?” Saa asked, looking around, an exaggerated look of disgust on her face.', '', '“Erm, yeh probably, sorry” muttered Twig, dropping down from his perch and hurriedly grabbing handfuls of rubbish.', '', '“It’s OK, only teasing.” She wasn’t, not really. The hideout had largely been Saa and Annfore’s work, had taken them years to get to this point--planning it, acquiring the seeds, spending every bit of life they could spare on speeding up its growth--, yet Twig’s mess made it feel alien and uncomfortable. Still, she didn’t want to make Twig feel bad about it. Saa and Annfore both had family huts of their own, places to live with families that loved them, however complicated. Twig had nobody but Saa and Annfore, and had been hiding away here for the best part of a year - he deserved somewhere he could make his own, somewhere he could feel comfortable and at home. She just wished he felt at home somewhere clean. “So what’ve you done this time to bring down the wrath of Trounce’s finest?”', '', '“The vines! Saa they worked so well!”', '', 'Saa swallowed. Twig was supposed to be keeping a low profile - what had he got himself into now? “I thought we were waiting until we had at least five stable seedlings before we tried it for real?”', '', 'Saa and Twig had travelled for several months late last year, hunting for any plants more useful than the weedy grass that grew in the dry, sandy soil around their village, and the vine had been their most promising discovery. They had been trying to establish a stable stock of it before experimenting with it, to avoid having to retread old ground to find more.', '', '“We do! Well, sort of four, but I dug down and a fifth seed looks kind of swollen, like it’s about to sprout, so I thought it was safe enough to-”', '', '“And your controlled, inconspicuous tests with our new, top secret find ended with soldiers harassing the entire town how, exactly?” Saa didn’t want to get angry. Twig was impulsive, even rash, at the best of times, and he’d been stuck here by himself for so long. It was no wonder he was getting bored. She had been so distracted recently she’d hardly had time to visit, and Annfore had been away for weeks. But couldn’t he have just caused mischief with some old sample, something that they had plenty of reserves of and which he knew he could control?', '', '“They didn’t, I played with it for a week before I tried anything! Saa it’s so good! It’s strong, really strong - I picked up that old chair with it, easy as you like - but it’s sort of supple and flexible, it goes right where you want it.”', '', 'Saa looked at the chair. Even from where she was, she could see several thin lines of small, light brown root fibres crossing it from top to bottom. “Twig! Look at that chair, it’s covered in roots! Tell me you didn’t try to steal something with this? You might as well leave an autograph!”', '', 'Twig looked down, hand rubbing the back of his head. “Well, I didn’t think it would matter. Nobody’s ever seen this before, so it’s not like they can trace it to us.”', '', '', 'Saa took a breath, tried to relax. It’s not like she was the model of perfect precautionary measures herself. “Well, we’d better be careful with using it again for a while. Anyway, what did you take?”', 'I like the premise and the introduction does a good job of presenting a world and the start of a plot line. I see the intro as two sections and the main points seem to be:', '', 'For me, this sets the stage quite nicely for following chapters.', '', 'There are some areas where I think the tension could be enhanced to make the intro even more gripping. In the first section, I did not initially make the connection that Saa was hiding from the guards as opposed to waiting in plain view to be questioned by them. When I recognized she was hiding, it broke my flow and I went back to reread to see if there is something I missed. Perhaps be more explicit in the opening sentence or so that she is hiding for dummies like me.', '', 'In the second section, I feel like there is (or should be) an underlying tension between Saa and Twig. As Saa has just gone through a harrowing event and probably still a little pumped with adrenalin, I could very much see her having a very loud argument with Twig. For some reason, the discussion seems more like an academic discussion. Perhaps doing it purely as a dialog sequence and deferring some of the descriptive text to later might allow them to have a full blown argument.', '', 'Again, I like the world and have a feel for where the upcoming plot line might go. This is important for an introduction. For me, I like introductions that grab me with some opening conflict. I think you have the ground work set for this, my suggestion is only to turn the dials up to ten on the opening sections.', \"Interesting setting and setup. I think the opening around the hut with the soldiers was a little too long. It took five paragraphs (admittedly short paragraphs) for a scene where not much happened. You do a good job of setting up the world here, but I think it could be done a little quicker, especially as the following scenes duplicate the sense of Saa's connection to the trees.\", '', 'One error:', '', 'I get the sense but obviously this sentence needs fixing.', '', \"I disagree with Wayne Mack about conflict between Saa and Twig. That relationship works fine for me as is. I think there is again too much description of the home and the process they went through to create it. You don't have to tell us all of that at once. It might be enough to know that it was a significant investment but whether that was in time, labour, magic or the equivalent of cash probably isn't too important right now. I'd rather you get on with the story and not give me so much background.\", '', \"Twig's talk of the seeds does exactly that. It's an excellent way to introduce magic, politics and group dynamics while setting up the story.\", '', 'Overall I like it. Promising!', 'I found this to be interesting.', 'However it needs editing, cleaning up, and tightening', '', 'For instance:', '', '', '', '', 'These are just the things I would look into when I do my edits and you might have better remedies.', '', 'Also cutting the fat will give you room to get closer to the character and let us know how she feels and show us a bit of why.', \"Such as why is she there? We really don't know why she has stood still or frozen. Is she afraid. Is she in a hurry? is she where she shouldn't be? Is she just the wrong color or race? Show this with some internal thought and get us engaged into why we should care about her being trapped somewhere while a couple of authorities are jawing and smoking with no regard for her discomfort. Show us why it would be bad for her and her sisters if they did see her and followed her.\", '', \"Right now you are forcing the reader to take your word for it and using space to tell us and not trusting the reader so you find a  need to explain that the Patrols don't continue into the night when what is most important is that late patrols have caught her off guard.\", \"I really enjoyed the character and the world building.  I'm finding the story a little slow and confusing in places.\", '', '', '', 'This is a good beginning. I would suggest taking out anything unnecessary and shortening the sentences as it will help increase the feeling of tension.', '', '', '', 'Standing still and time passing is a point that is laboured a bit much. By this point it is becoming repetitive.', '', '', '', '', '', '', \"This I found confusing. The world is built well but I need more about the factory to fit it in. And I'm unsure, yet, what unlife means. I'm sure both are interesting but here it's confusing.\", '', '', \"This is either over described or under described.  I feel like you are trying to tell us something about the forest and Saa's relationship with it. That maybe there is some fantasy here.\", '', '', '', '', 'Annfore comes out of nowhere and at this point goes nowhere. Maybe introduce her later in a different way.', 'I think your writing is very good. The worldbuilding felt unique and well thought-out.', '', \"My only issue was that I felt you could have gone into greater depth of detail about things--like the soldiers, the setting (its relative location and/or history), maybe a little more about Twig and their abilities. I'm not saying you should add in paragraphs of history and explain everything, but I would have like a little specificity sprinkled in throughout the already existing narrative so that I could have gotten a better feel for the world of the story and the characters.\", '', 'This feels like a great start to a story, good luck on the rest of it!', '\"Saa stood still, leaning against the south trunk of the half-grown hut. Patrols didn’t usually continue this late into the evening; she had been caught off guard.\"', \"Great set up. However, If this were my story I'd consider starting with the second sentence. That way, the reader is instantly drawn into a dilemma and a character with a problem. I'd then put the first sentence right after (or soon after at least) as it is still necessary: it gives a name and let's us know huts are 'grown' in this world.\", 'Keep up the good work and have fun!', \"Thanks so much all!! That's all really really useful.\", '', 'I think I need to spend a bit more time working on plot before I keep writing, but all of your advice will really help going forward. Thanks again!', \"I liked this. It drew me in even though I suspect it's not a genre I would normally read. That's an accomplishment!\", '', \"The piece offers some strong imagery and direct, believable dialogue. It's a healthy start to something longer because it develops a sense of suspense.\", '', \"The sample doesn't answer all the questions that develop in the reader's mind about this new world he's entering, and that's fine. Let the reader discover your world over time as he reads further into your novel.\", '', 'For improvement --', '', 'I agree 100% with J-WO to eliminate the first sentence. I like rocketing the reader directly into the tension of those patrols and what they could be about.', '', 'I found many small nits that could be eliminated by closer editing --', '', '* be trying  ->  try', '* Time passed slowly, like thick, viscous sap  ->  Time passed like thick, viscous sap', '* “I might have an inkling”  -> “I might have an inkling.”   [period missing]', '* “Erm, yeh probably, sorry” muttered Twig, -> “Erm, yeh probably, sorry,” muttered Twig,   [comma missing]', \"* They had been trying  -> They'd tried [Alter most the past continuous tenses in the sample to the simple past tense]\", '', \"I suspect you probably know that the piece has these minor blemishes and presented it here regardless, but it's important to realize that a more thorough edit is required at some point before going forward.\", '', \"My bottom line -- impressive. A good edit and you've really got something here.\", 'Thanks so much', \", that's both very generous and very helpful! I'm really looking forward to writing more\", 'I would suggest that you need a better hook. Your hook doesn’t hint at the plot, the character, or themes. It’s simply a statement of the character’s name with a hint of the setting. It doesn’t create a sense of urgency regarding the patrols. I’m not saying you must start with an action scene. But perhaps use the patrols to set an ominous tone. Maybe give some hints into Saa’s character by how she reacts.', 'Part of the reason I feel there’s a lack of urgency is that the patrols are generic brutish guards. A good hook could be highlighting something strange about them. Maybe something intimidating, eye-catching, and followed up by something along lines of, “they weren’t supposed to be out this late.” Maybe when Saa is escaping back to her home fragments of the guards are revealed through the shrubbery. Giving just enough information to let the reader create a picture, then finish it through their imagination is more impactful than just describing them. It could be used to sell the mysteriousness of the guards by only revealing glimmers of them.', 'I also feel like there’s a lack of urgency because it takes a while to get to the point. Maybe the story needs to start later than you originally had it at. Perhaps start with Saa scrambling into her hideout with the remark that the patrols were out later than usual. The ensuing conversation between them and other characters could be used to build up the patrols as intimidating. Or maybe start where you did, but find a way to condense it for better pacing.', \"This is some great writing here Topher you've made your world resonate with me and it's definitely a story I would like to read more of, the writing reminds me of Suzanne Collins who wrote the hunger games although with a more mature writing style (which was sorely lacking from that story) but with a more fantasy setting and I'd love to see it explored more.\", '', \"I agree with Wayne that I wasn't aware Saa was trying to hide when reading that first paragraph and making that clearer would add to the suspense that you're creating. Also I agree with autoretscriptor about his corrections especially the sap part as I had to read it a couple of times to get the meaning.\", '', \"However I disagree with Sonicsouls that you should remove the guard scene, he's right that maybe it needs to be more urgent but that could perhaps be increased by having them actually discover Saa and her having to run away. Also using J-WO's suggestions will help with that.\", '', 'The world is almost reminicent of Naucisaa valley of the wind by studio ghibli, are the characters confined to spaces of industrialisation and the forest is kind of sentient, trying to rid itself of the \"factories\"? It seemed like Saa was almost scared of using unknown plants because they could take over and not be controlled, apart from the fact it draws unwanted attention.', '', 'All in all, I don\\'t have much more to add because I think it\\'s great already the \"magic\" system is interesting and I want to see how Saa et al are going to use it overthrow this government which seems to hate the, I want to say \"druids\"?', 'Thanks a lot for your very kind words', \"! To be honest I'd kind of lost motivation with my writing since before Christmas, mainly because of real life stuff, and seeing your generous comments pop up has been a nice prompt to get back to writing\", '', \"I'm still trying to work out what the overall plot might look like, but hadn't planned on the forest being sentient, no - although that is a fascinating idea! The overarching idea with the magic system is that everyone has the ability to use magic like this, and that it used to be a pretty everyday part of life, but that a class of people had essentially monopolised the means of using it (by killing the forest and very tightly controlling the supply of seeds, only allowing plants that have been bred to be infertile to be bought and sold). So most workers are only able to use their magic usefully in factories owned by that class. The idea was that Saa et al would be something akin to hackers in the cyberpunk genre, using ingenious or black market technology (like the vine they had discovered) to get by outside this system.\", '', 'Thanks also', 'for your helpful comments. As I said, this is very early days so I will definitely give more thought to finding a decent hook for the beginning once things have moved along a bit more.', \"- Glad to hear I motivated you somewhat, so this ruling class is kinda like Monsanto in our world! (If you didn't know they have tight control over the seeds that most famers use. They often only give seeds that don't grow into plants that themselves give seeds, requiring farmers to always buy from them and they essentially have a monopoly on it. But going from your story, I guess that was the inspiration!\", ')', 'Yes pretty much', \"! That wasn't the original motivation (which was essentially to portray exploitation through a fantasy setting), but once I'd decided that the magic would involve the ability to guide and grow plants it seemed like the obvious route to go down. I have read a lot about Monsanto in the past, but hadn't actually made the connection while writing this - maybe I should do some more reading about them for inspiration!\", 'I am new to this so sorry if I cant help much.', \"I liked the story a lot and would want to read more especially after the cliff hanger at the end. I like the theme of the authoritarian government and the magic plant people. There is a name for this that I cant remember, I think it was Botanokinesis? I like the characters and there personality's. For an improvement it would be nice if there were some forest animal sounds, because this is a forest that seems to have very little animals, may be she could surprised by a fox of something?\", \"First of all, I'm so sorry that teacher wrecked you for so long. Authority who rips the love of creation right out of our hands is inexcusably cruel, and I'm so, SO glad to see you're able to move past it and begin to tell your tales again.\", '', \"One thing is for sure: while not writing, you must have been reading, because this is really, REALLY solid. It's so solid that I get the rare joy having to nitpick, since it's just little details that seem off.\", '', 'Punctuation right here: \"growth--, yet Twig’s mess\" - I think you meant an em-dash or a comma, not both.', '', 'Right now, the pacing is conversation - reflection - conversation - reflection, so if you wanted to break that up a little, you could change this part:', '', '', '', 'And make that something they actually talk about. It would keep the pace moving, avoid things feeling repetitive, and set up both their characters and their conflict in the present, rather than just in her head.', '', \"That's really it for me. I enjoyed this, and I would 100% have kept reading it if I'd encountered this first couple of pages.\", '', 'KEEP WRITING. Those lies that teacher told you were just that: lies.', \"- thanks a lot! That's a good idea, thanks. I want to do something with animals later in the book (just like these people grow plants, there is an army that transform animals to be stronger and more easily trainable to fight with), so setting up what animals are in the local area here would be good.\", '', '', \"- thanks so much! That's very kind, and very helpful. I like your suggestion of tweaking that passage to be something they talk about rather than just reflection, thanks.  I have still been writing, though quite slowly due to life stuff. I've written about two full chapters since I posted this - I'll try to post some more writing here soon\", 'thanks again for your encouragement!', '\"Saa stood still, leaning against the south trunk of the half-grown hut. Patrols didn’t usually continue this late into the evening; she had been caught off guard\"', '', 'A solid start!

But then I've not knowingly read any Tanith Lee I liked much, to be honest, and this fantasy was simply okay. As an aside, it's interesting that the magazine is called Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, as this is clearly fantasy.

The suggestion is that misdirected technological advance will lead to lazy lawlessness, but the plot tells this rather bluntly without exploring the idea as fully as it could have been, and overall, its less convincing than one hope's it will be from half-way in.

In this novelette, Leinster takes us to the end of days on Earth, now a frozen and abandoned planet with a dying red sun. Researchers have gone back to try to find a way to stop a galactic collapse that will signal the end of the universe in less than five years. The destructive force moves much faster than light, apparently. And pirates come and attack them, so they need to find a way to leave the universe sharpish.

Also in this issue, there is an obituary feature to Theodore Sturgeon, who sadly passed away the previous year, with short eulogies by Harlan Ellison, Damon Knight, Isaac Asimov, Brian Aldiss, Stephen King and Somtow Sucharitkul, which make for interesting reading.', '', '', \"This 'cyberpunk' short story was nominated for the Nebula and Locus Awards for best short story.

The protagonist is encouraged to follow suit, as virtual entities are so popular and cool with the masses. The story was ahead of its time, in the sense that there are parallels here to how social networking has taken over many peoples sense of value, while not being 'real' the immediate physical sense.

More than half his writing was in collaboration with his wife C. L. Moore, though this novella was by Kuttner alone. This is best described as pseudo-science fantasy. A small band of treasure-seeking adventurers trek deep into the Brazilian rainforest in search of a rich lode of radium. Arriving at the epicenter of their search, they find a land in which the animals, plant life and even the land and rocks are joined into a cohesive living thing. Strange animal-plant-stone 'things' abound. The scientific basis of all this is non-existent of course, and it's all very daft. But on a more positive note, it's written with the pulpy exuberance of the early sword-and-sorcery type adventure tales, and also with a degree of professionalism by Kuttner, that make it not only bearable, but strangely enjoyable. It's not great, indeed in some ways it is awful, and yet it's not without merit as a fun read, very much of its time.\", '', '', 'Another giant of the pulp era, Leinster (1896-1975) started publishing SF in 1918 (', ', published in T', \") and continued until shortly before his death. It's perhaps a result of his generation (born in the 19th century), but the ingrained sexism in this story is hard to pass over. I'm usually pretty tolerant of outdated cultural mores, but others of the time wrote of women and included key female characters, so it wasn't impossible. In this novelette, Leinster takes us to the end of days on Earth, now a frozen and abandoned planet with a dying red sun. Researchers have gone back to try to find a way to stop a galactic collapse that will signal the end of the universe in less than five years. The destructive force moves much faster than light, apparently. And pirates come and attack them, so they need to find a way to leave the universe sharpish. Scientifically its very silly of course, and while this was also the case with the Kuttner, that story was presented as a boys'-own kind of fantasy adventure and got away with it. This didn't work so well for me. I'm not so sure Leinster is one of my favourite golden age authors.\", '', '', \"Zagat (1896-1949) was prolific and wrote a lot of SF stories, mostly sold to the pulps in the 1930's and '40's. I'm not too familiar with his work, but he was successful enough to give up work as a lawyer to write full time in the last two decades of his life. This short story was a good deal more successful than the Leinster for me. A young physics researcher identifies something heading on a collision course for Earth by radar, but which cannot be seen by telescopes. What can it be, and should he tell anyone? This was nicely done, being entertaining, and quite a neat idea. The girlfriend of the protagonist also had some agency and spirit, which was nice to see.\", '', '', \"A major and prolific figure in SF and fantasy, of course, de Camp won the SFWA Grand Master Award in 1979 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984. This short story was a well-written and entertaining hoot. It's a fantasy ghost story; a penny-pinching landlord has ghosts scaring off his tenants and so he hires various people to try and get rid of them. The conversations, scenarios and final solution are comedic and entertaining. Recommended if you can find it, as a fine example of an amusing ghost story.\", '', '', \"This was only the third story of Vance's to be published.

Exciting and intriguing, Vance paints a rounded picture of the aliens through Wratch's new compound eyes, describing their advantages and perspective. The only negative to this story would be that it was a touch short. It's actually a novelette of decent size, but its starts more like a novel and ends up a little rushed perhaps.

Asimov\\'s editorial in this edition is bouncily written as always; he comments on the fact the magazine reached 100 issues, and introduces Gardner Dozois as the new editor of the magazine (Asimov\\'s role was always as \"Editorial Director\" of course, not as the actual editor who selected the content). Also in this issue, there is an obituary feature to Theodore Sturgeon, who sadly passed away the previous year, with short eulogies by Harlan Ellison, Damon Knight, Isaac Asimov, Brian Aldiss, Stephen King and Somtow Sucharitkul, which make for interesting reading.', '', '', \"This 'cyberpunk' short story was nominated for the Nebula and Locus Awards for best short story. It wasn't especially to my taste, being cyberpunk, and also as it was written in a stylised manner for effect, I felt, rather rather than to its merit. A Pretty boy (capital P) depends on attention for his sense of worth and encounters another such 'Pretty boy' in a club who has crossed-over into becoming a computer representation of himself (SAD, or 'self-aware data'). The protagonist is encouraged to follow suit, as virtual entities are so popular and cool with the masses. The story was ahead of its time, in the sense that there are parallels here to how social networking has taken over many peoples sense of value, while not being 'real' the immediate physical sense. I can see there is quality here, but it just isn't my kind of story.\", '', '', \"A blue-collar sheet metal worker, with a love for the music of British guitar ace Jeff Beck, takes a drug that he is assured will gives him whatever he wants.

It's entertaining enough, as Asimov always writes so breezily, but its a bit of fluff really and wouldn't be seen as very politically correct these days. Moreover, the end is signposted from the start, so as a short story it's relatively weak.\", \"I read this issue (and all of 1986) way back when.

I never could work out whether Stephenson was taking the whole thing seriously or not - the concepts, the names, the ending and the gun-ho attitude of the characters to supposedly their impending doom, all suggest a very tongue in cheek approach, but the historical element was so very very serious.

The devastation has extended to all parts of our society, and that includes science fiction.', '', 'Like the rest of the publishing industry, science fiction has struggled. Big publishers have reduced their publishing list during the pandemic, small publishers have ended up with book stocks they cannot move on because conventions have gone virtual, a few have gone out of business and those with print of demand capability have complained they are not selling their books through the likes of Amazon. It is not helped that this is also election year in the USA when traditionally book sales go down in numbers. There is a hiatus in film production with live actors and of course unless people can work from home, there has been limited access to production facilities for animated films.', '', 'It will take quite a few months to see the full impact of all this. One thing we do know is that in the publishing industry as a whole, an unprecedented 600 books will be published on 3rd September – a combination of delayed publishing and hoping to catch the Christmas market. On the minus side a lot of people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, which means people will not have as much to spend. So it is a greater number of books chasing a smaller pot of people’s spare cash for entertainment.', '', 'Yes, you could counter-argue that reading books is a safe pandemic activity and therefore more likely to be taken up. But people have missed socialising, as the boom in the next best thing, zooming over the internet has shown. And it is socialising that will take priority over home entertainment for people in general.', '', 'One side effect of the pandemic is to make people aware of how science can and does advise society, and more importantly that going against of science can cost people dearly. The focus at the moment is quite reasonably on surviving and beating Covid-19. It’s the nearest crocodile snapping at everyone’s feet. But the point is well-made.', '', 'Of course science fiction will supply a tranche of new stories based on the pandemic. This is what writers are experiencing at the moment and they have to write from experience too a greater or lesser extent. I view that more as a way of recording the impact of the pandemic through story. And we need to record this pandemic because this is the first time such a devastating virus will be fought not just with the traditional  quarantining, but also in due course and soon as safely possible with a vaccine.', '', 'Science fiction stories based on the pandemic will also provide a wish list of what we wanted to see during the pandemic, like for example the vaccine being developed far more quickly. This will help develop a roadmap for the research scientists for tomorrow and many decades to come.', '', 'What of other not so pressing global problems?', '', 'Another close snapping crocodile is climate change due to pollution. Yes, work is being done to reduce the projected pollution of so many substances, including carbon dioxide, methane, plastics… this list can go on for quite a bit.', '', 'We have seen quite a few stories about the impact of climate change, written as warnings for our future society. Yes they have had an impact, but not nearly enough for solving the overall problem. All that has been done is delay the inevitable.', '', 'Part of the issue that we do not fully understand all the interactions and impacts of climate change. Research is ongoing, and every so often there is a significant new piece of research that alters our perception what is actually going on, and therefore we must act in a slightly different way. (Slightly here refers to method rather than quantity of action.)', '', 'What is needed is solutions. Science fiction writers can suggest some of those, based on the science and understanding of what is going on in climate change. The point here is that', '.', '', 'This is true of any subject. If you look at the very successful science fiction writers of today, you’ll find a lot have studied the subjects they write about before they even put fingertip to keyboard. Alastair Reynolds with his degrees and work in astrophysics, Adrian Tchaikovsky with his understanding of insects to name but two.', '', 'A science fiction writer also needs to keep up with the latest thinking in their subject area. They need to read about the advances to build on what they already know. Also science fiction writers need a basic understanding of the effects of the development of other sciences. They need to read the science news columns about what things can do in the near future. Where to find these columns?', '', 'Yes they are few and far between, but they are there where you know to find them. Only issue is that their coverage of the science subjects is rather hit and miss. They go for the spectacular ideas that catch the imagination, not the little detail that makes all the difference downstream.', '', 'What is really needed is a go-to place for such reports. This was the original idea behind the New Scientist magazine. But commercial pressures have slimmed it down in terms of content over the years. It has more the feel of specialist magazine commercially than the general magazine it wants to be to the public, certainly judging by the price.', '', 'A true hybrid between science reporting and science fiction stories does not really exist. Yes there are science commentary columns in some science fiction magazines or a thread for science topics tucked away on some science fiction websites. But a balanced offering? Not really.', '', 'Maybe now is the time to produce such a hybrid science and science fiction magazine or website, particularly as the value of science has recently been shown to have an impact on society.', 'This is one reason why chrons - since the very beginning - had sections for history and science news. Not so much because I expect writers to use these to come up with solutions for modern problems, as much as because I always hoped some of the articles posted there would help inspire writers in the community.', '', \"Another issue, though, is that writers are limited by their inspiration. I'd love to write a science fiction novel about planetary exploration in the solar system, but I don't have inspiration for a story to go with it.

Near future Science-Fiction needs to write about staying on the planet, not only escaping it. It needs to write about solving while knee-deep in failure, not after the stable door has fallen off – horse bolted. Perhaps then, we can't save everyone – we need to write about that, without it being considered too much like doomsday writing.

We fail to agree on a definition.', '', 'People will write whatever they want, or whatever they think will sell. At the end of the day readers will read whatever interests or entertains them. For the majority that is light entertainment and a bit of escapism. Some people will gravitate towards more “ serious” stuff with an environmental or political polemic, but tbh that is likely to be a minority even if there is something truly exceptional about the writing.', \"I also disagree with the premise, for the same reason that I don't think steampunk should be about steam-powered global solutions.\", 'You only have to look in this very forum to read threads about blowing up stars with mega-weapons.', 'Fiction is about people.', 'I think that, if you read the original post the wrong way, it gets very close to one of my pet hates: \"The only real SF is hard SF\". (Funny how you never see anyone saying the opposite.) But read correctly, I think it has a point, in that it is wrong to use science fiction to peddle outright lies, and that, by doing so, an SF writer quickly becomes a propagandist.', '', 'SF is a setting rather than a style (if those are the right words), and so we have SF novels that are really war stores, crime stories, Westerns and romances, but \"in space\". There\\'s nothing wrong with pure escapism, provided that\\'s what it genuinely is. There\\'s room for a gentle, environmentalist novel about ecology on another planet, and also a gung-ho story about the marines shooting goddam Martian commies. The problem comes when either of these is used to advance theories that are false or deeply partisan. This is a sliding scale but you can usually tell.', '', 'I also suspect that many of us writers lack the skill and knowledge to make viable suggestions. It\\'s one thing to say something like \"the colonists have lots of solar panels and wind farms to protect the environment\" (as I am currently doing) but another to explain how they make the solar panels isn\\'t really within the ambit of the writer. I think a writer is entitled to say what would be a good or bad outcome without having to fully explain the backstory that would get them to that outcome.', \"Good comments Toby. I wouldn't go perhaps as far to say that the original post was really going to 'the only real SF is hard SF', but taken to it's logical extreme it seems to head that way. Want to write about space travel, well, you'd better have a PhD in astrophyiscs, a la Alastair Reynolds. I'm being a tad unfair, but that seems to be the general jist!\", '', 'Science fiction is', 'just about \\'solutions\\' to to solve scientific problems. SF writers write about truths and ideas that they are passionate about and some may want to frame their stories with current science. And a few may want to write \\'what if\\' stories based on current speculations that real scientists are pondering. And as you point out, some are just keen to provide entertainment with a SF setting. SF, to me, is a broad church with many distinct genres - it\\'s what makes it vibrant and interesting. Hard SF has it\\'s place as one of many genres inside that. The above seems a call to a slightly more focused genre or manifesto for a sub-genre - like \"mundane science fiction\"*.', '', \"But if I want to read real science and possible solutions, then I read what real scientist are writing, not SF writers.

I bought 2 P K Dick books on eBay at really good prices and would have read them immediately as I always did, but they sit somewhere, unread. I was writing new poetry every week, now I rewrite old material, making it easier to understand and even more relevant to current conditions. But nothing new written, until 2 weeks ago, then I wrote some new stuff based on current conditions. Perhaps I was thinking things were getting better, even though the poems did not reflect a good outlook. The large metro/urban/suburban/rural region I live in was showing signs of 1 percent infection rate as determined by testing, which is its own quagmire. But now the hospitalizations have gone from 2 digits state wide to 3 digits, and once again growing every week, just like last time. People are tired of flowing with the routine.

It works in room temperature with ordinary water and ordinary air bubbles and is powered by low power ultrasonic sound. Up to 10 milliwatts but only for a few picoseconds. No laser light has been created yet, but people are thinking about it.\", '', \"I gather sonluminescance is a science mystery and people are grabbing at various theories to explain it. I'm trying to get my head around it, and have got stuck on the silly business of what really is heat. At school we were taught get can be transferred by conduction (i.e. touching materials), convection (think air currents moving masses of heated particles) and radiation (which I take to be infrared in the electromagnetic spectrum). How are conduction and radiation related in the physics sense?\", \"I remember that someone - Philip Jose Farmer, maybe - once wrote a story where some demon-like aliens went around possessing people's brains and taking them on violent joyrides, and society had partially evolved to deal with it. However, ultimately nothing could be done to stop the aliens and it was basically the end of normal life. A depressing ending, but it was one of the few stories I can think of where a society had tried to adapt to something that wasn't a full-scale apocalypse.\"]"

We’ve got an Ali Baba!”', '', 'Like any occupation, Organ Salvage (or Meat Grinding, as the media like to called it with their usual scorn and hauteur) had its own dictionary of insider terminology.

On my first pass, I found myself skimming over the text looking for the grabber - the justification for reading the story. I felt I was drowning in backstory and never got a sense of the current situation the characters were in. Give me a sense of them picking through a field of dead bodies and spinning through a litany of current events. It is good to have a solid back story, but give it to me in small doses throughout the novel.', '', 'I think the concept of a body part market is a fascinating world to explore. See if the opening chapter can be tightened up. Give the reader some reason to be concerned about the main character(s) in the first paragraph or so.

This is good input.\", '', 'The problem with people like me (my education background is political science, not literature) is we tend to get a little too analytical. More field manual than ballad. Glad you brought this up.', 'I think you certainly have an interesting premise. I would have liked the two characters to have been easier to distinguish--their ways of talking were very similar (at least to me) such that I had a hard time telling them apart.

I think you could have introduced the name of \"Oscar the Grouch\" much earlier when the MC was lamenting how much of it there was. The line \"[Organ Salvage] had its own dictionary of insider terminology\" is a bit on the nose, especially if we are in one of the character\\'s heads. The restatement that Ali Baba is AB- is unnecessary because you established that when the characters found the AB- corpse. Last, it felt strange for you to use the abbreviation and then immediately provide what it stands for in the same sentence (I would have preferred you call it \"Physiological Integrity Rating\" the first time, then use the initials afterwards). In my opinion, this scene will flow a lot better if you can excise all the times you repeat yourself or overexplain something.', '', \"I think that you have the beginnings of a good story; certainly the premise is interesting and the world you've built for it feels lived in.\", '', '', \"Thanks for posting.

Reason is two fold. The use of the word incessant confused me since in this POV we only see the examiner gripe once. So it feels like the writer is injecting themselves into the story to make me view the character a certain way. Either more dialogue can be used to do this, or to have narrative fill in the gap - ie. Javeon muttered a silent curse as his incessant griping over the past hour was too much.', \"Also, the use of the word unregenerate is odd. I don't know what it means (ie its not common so likely there is a fair amount of readers who wouldn't either), and it's five syllables make for a clunky sentence.

Turney writes well and gives us likeable protagonists and thoroughly despicable antagonists and a couple of grey-area characters in between. My main complaint with this and all the previous books is the the main protagonists is fantastically smart or fantastically stupid in turn as demanded by the plot. There is little consistency in this aspect of his character. But still a good story and an interesting take on this politically chaotic period of Roman history. 4/5 stars.\", '', '', \"- mostly written, I suspect, by Baxter there are occasional flashes of Pratchett's brilliant absurdity to lighten it. The first book presented the reader with an interesting multiverse which worked well and presented interesting social challenges to humanity.

A very good examination of how we humans take so much bad baggage with us when colonising new worlds, whether they be across oceans or across multiple universes. 4/5 stars.\", '', '', \"- set just after 9/11 (in fact it has been suggested that it had already been mostly written and Gibson had to write 9/11 into it after the event). I'm really not sure where I stand on this one. The writing and story are good, very good even, not the frenetic cyberpunk writing of Neuromancer but still jargon filled; just a different sort of jargon. And this is where my problems began. The whole book is obsessed with and set around the world of high fashion, branding and marketing. I absolutely loathed this aspect, even if it is meant to be satirical (and I'm not sure about that) it still a world of backbiting, appearance-obsessed, yuppie sociopaths and I hate everything about them. I did back then and I still do now. This meant that I simply could neither like nor empathise with any of the characters and the writing was completely filled with Gucci this and Prada that making me skim over at least a third of the actual prose.

Never mind, the book is excellent without it and knocks socks off the movies anyway!

In many ways, it\\'s a load of old rubbish.  And yet, I think I liked it.

You would think SFF, by its nature a genre of imagination, would be replete with myriad true originals, but in fact there are only a few I think. They derive from and follow no-one else, they plow their own literary furrow and they have a signature style of writing that surely was never taught.  I can only think of two authors who definitely fit this description: Lafferty and Cordwainer Smith, and you could perhaps include PKD as an honourable mention.

Innumerable other examples, perhaps on a smaller scale, could be provided.  It\\'s fine to use \"inhuman\" as an emotive word if \"evil\" sticks in your throat, but philosophically it won\\'t do.

Call them \"inhuman\" and you\\'re (in effect) removing them from the human.   Acknowledge evil as something possible (perhaps endemic) in human beings and you can deal with their humanity more seriously.  I can prove that.  Read Dostoevsky.  Read, for example, the chapter of Stavrogin\\'s Confession, now typically printed as an appendix to', '/', '/', '(printed there because it was suppressed till after the author\\'s death).

And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart—and through all human hearts.

Each has strengths and weaknesses, and none are expressly either theistic or atheistic (and hopefully therefore avoid the prohibition of discussing religion on this forum!). I'll go through these in a little detail, not so much to try to convince anyone regarding ethics one way or another, but to give some ideas of the ideas and potential ways this could be utilized in narratives. To this end, while I will happily provide clarifications, I won't engage in much back and forth about the ideas themselves on this forum. Again, my goal here is to provide information, not stir up debate. If you want to debate ethics, PM me.\", '', 'Natural law theory is that ethics are a brute fact, whether that be because of a divine figure or figures declaring them to be thus or something innate within humanity. However, this model is very susceptible to the Euthyphro dilemma. As Socrates reported phrased it, do the gods love good action because it is good, or is it good because the gods love it (which could also be stated, does it align with human nature because it is good, or is it good because it aligns with human nature). If the former, the natural question is, \"Ok, then what defines what is good?\", as it being loved (or aligning with) because it is good requires a definition of good outside of the gods (or human nature). If it is the latter, 2 questions emerge. First, what if the gods disagree/human nature is variant on a point? Which side wins out? Second, if the gods/human nature were different, would this not change the definition of good? To be honest, I haven\\'t seen much by way of solid response to this dilemma from NL theory.', '', 'Utilitarianism is likely one of the more familiar ideas, but primarily because it has a rather sorted reputation. The basic premise is that you do the actions which cause the most benefit for the most people, and this can be applied in a theistic (God/the gods did these calculations and provided guidance on what would be best) or atheistic (which is much more commonly depicted). The downside for this is twofold. First, it is nearly, if not actually, impossible to calculate the effects of every action on every person, especially where other ethical actors must react to the action, much less rate the quality or lack of quality of these effects. Second, even in versions where the positives and negatives are weighted (i.e. there is a gradation of how positive or how negative an effect is.), you can still come to some particularly horrible conclusions where if a horrific action can be performed to a small enough population which generates even a cursory benefit to a large enough population, this should be considered morally good. I trust the creative and occasionally devious minds of SFF enthusiasts can imagine such circumstances...', '', 'Deontology is rather complicated. It is similar to Natural Law in that good is a brute fact, but different in the basis in that it defines good as actions which can be taken which do not create a contradiction if universalized. An example is lying. If everyone were to lie, no one would believe what anyone says, making lying impossible. The problem with this theory is if the actions are defined narrowly enough, many inarguably \"bad\" things can be justified. Genocide, for example, could be justified if it is defined as, \"The extermination of [insert target group here]\".', '', \"Virtue ethics is the idea that we should undertake actions not so much based on the actions themselves, but on the sort of people these actions make us. In other words, we should want to cultivate virtues like reliability, honesty, charity, etc. and therefore do actions which make us those sorts of people. The objection raised here is twofold. First, it pushes back the question of ethics to what sort of virtues are ethical, but doesn't provide much guidance on which virtues are ethical and why. Second, there are many potential conflicts between virtues, and there is little to no guidance on what should be preferred here.\", '', 'Neo-platonism is a kinda strange one too... it holds that different virtues and vices are actually existing but immaterial as \"abstract objects\", along with numbers, ideas, etc. This, of course, has the same challenges of several others; it just moves the problem back rather than actually addressing the problem, what happens when the values contradict each other, etc. It also has the unique questions of in what universe do they exist (as it\\'s expressly stated abstract objects are immaterial), and how do they come to be?', '', \"Lastly, moral relativism is the idea that there aren't objective morals of any sort, but is defined by the individual (or society, in some settings). I must note here, in the interest of fairness, that I've not met or read a\", 'who argues on behalf of moral relativism, despite it being a prevalent idea in other disciplines, have had two separate philosophy professors (one theist and one athiestic Buddhist) from different universities both say they know of no philosophers who argue affirmatively for it, and in my rather extensive and detailed metaethics textbook, the article on moral relativism was written by an anthropologist. Of course, this doesn\\'t mean it\\'s correct or incorrect, but for fairness, I feel that information needs to be provided. At any rate, the critique of moral relativism is that it removes any potential to consider another\\'s actions as unethical in any real sense, regardless of how monstrous the action may be. For example, the forcible capture of a people group for chattel slavery cannot be condemned, because the slave traders are merely doing what they believe is ethical. And, literally any position taken to explain why that would be mistaken would move the person into one of the above mentioned ethical positions (e.g. \"That infringes on another\\'s right to chose for themselves\" assumes that such a right ought be protected, which moral relativism makes no provision for. Therefore, it makes an assumption of some other standard somewhere which guarantees that right.). Further, it is argued that moral relativism is self-contradictory (\"So, it\\'s universally true for all regarding right and wrong that there are no universal truths regarding right and wrong?\").', '', \"Again, I say that all of this is intended strictly for information purposes, and most, if not all, of the positions describe have some sort of rebuttal for the contentions raised. If anyone particularly wants to argue any of these points, I'll be happy to engage with PM, but much discussion here on the forums will likely violate the rules of the forum.\", '', \"I'll also say that metaethic, while potentially interesting to keep in mind while writing, isn't going to play much into the character. Applied ethics, which is informed by the metaethical position taken, will be much more important to characterization. So to the extent this and other posts here help with getting into the mind of the protagonist, have at it!\", \"I have a problem when it comes to good v evil, specifically when dealing with demons and such. I watch stuff like Ghost Adventures, bit of fun really, there might be something in it, or it might just be, a bit of fun. Anyway they often have someone who is possessed by a demon and they bring a priest in for an exorcism. The problem for me is, I'm atheist so don't believe in god or heaven etc, so therefore I can't believe in the devil either, after all he is just a different kind of god.\", 'I would agree with you that the audience is largely unconcerned with theories themselves. It seems to me that most audiences prefer stories where the characters are believable, and this requires a certain degree of internal consistency so that the audience can anticipate to a degree the range of possible actions one can take. This is why there is so much antagonism regarding characters who act in ways inconsistent with themselves. But, to make such a consistent character, some theory work can be helpful, so that the author understands what makes them do what they do. So I see this sort of discussion as a matter which will be largely invisible to the audience, but writers keep in mind while world building.', '', 'I\\'ll let history sort out whether audiences prefer optimistic or \"dark\" writing though...', '', 'Not touching this with a 3m pole apart from saying there are ethical systems of good and evil which do not require any sort of supernatural figure, as well as those which state that ethics cannot be universal without them, and therefore ethics is not universal.', \"As someone who works in publishing, and as a student of history, history does not sort out anything. This fake idea that living in the 21st Century has somehow changed people is indeed fake. Writers who do good work, who get noticed, are the ones who are remembered by readers - not history. I have no time to plow through blogs or podcasts which boil down to one man's opinion.\", '', 'Quality writing is built on a solid foundation. Yes, the writer has to understand the behind the scenes mechanics. I went to the open house of a prestigious art school for three years. In every year, most of the first year students made the same mistakes, the second year showed some improvement, the third year began to reveal a few gems. By fourth year, more gems and more overall improvement.', '', \"For writers as well, that same learning curve will never go away. After personally rejecting hundreds of manuscripts at the company I work for, I saw the same mistakes over and over. No one can say that today, the writer's job is somehow easier because he can publish electronically. No one can say that knowledge is conferred on people today. It takes a lot of work, research into the mechanics, and more work. There is no other way.\", 'Now, I thought,', '.  But I looked up \"sercon\" and saw it can be taken in a non-complimentary way, while this old fan was thinking in complimentary terms.', '', '', '', 'I wondered if anyone cared to nominate works of science fiction (not fantasy, not horror) that deal with evil (or \"inhumanity\") in a noteworthy way.

The point I was trying to make is that the question of what defines evil is a vastly complex one, with an entire dedicated branch of philosophy, and if we want to discuss that here, a brief summary of the major positions may prove valuable. My opinion is that applied ethics is more directly relevant for the writer, though, as this gets into the specifics of the actions one should or should not take, rather than the logical basis for those actions. Forgive me if this came across as a, \"Well,', '\"', '', 'Thanks for taking the time to respond.', '', \"Of course, there is nothing contestable in the second two paragraphs you provided; the development of a writers' ability is the express purpose of large swaths of this forum, and I am massively indebted to this forum for my development thus far. Unfortunately, some writers aren't willing to put in the work, don't have the fortitude to receive critique, or for whatever other reason don't give themselves time to develop before attempting to publish.\", '', 'And, forgive the ambiguity of my earlier statement. My intended message was \"The topic of optimism vs. \"dark\" fiction, while interesting, is outside of the current topic of discussion, and I\\'d rather stay on topic. However, if I just ignore the point, it will look like I just didn\\'t see it, so I need to reference it at some level.\" In other words, I\\'ll be happy to discuss this in another context (I think the best forum for this is perhaps the traditional or self publishing forum), but I don\\'t think it\\'s overly relevant to the nature of evil itself, and out of respect for the OP, I\\'d rather not comment much here. I do appreciate your understanding in this matter.', 'Thank you for your reply. There are a number of ways writers can learn their craft. Forums can help but any good advice must be applied to be of any use.', '', 'Back to the topic, I think the average reader has a firm idea of the nature of evil. Ambiguity can be discussed but at the end of the day a decision must be made. How do I portray it?', 'TBH, I think the answer is going to vary massively, depending on your genre, themes, intended audience, etc...', '', 'Evil in, say, Saturday morning cartoons aimed at young children is typically rather one dimensional. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing; in fact, many parents may prefer their 6 year olds not be faced with complex ethical dilemmas while they eat their Cheerios which may cause them to think lying to Mom and Dad is ok... but I suspect such an antagonist would be rarely satisfying for an adult targeting novel exploring the intricacies of international (or, perhaps given the forum, interplanetary) politics or racial tensions. As such, I would suggest that knowing the genre and audience will significantly inform the development of the antagonist (or protagonist, for that matter) character and actions.', 'Hello!. Well, broadly speaking, there are the good characters who do good things, the characters who do bad things, and as several have said, the evil characters who have a deviant mentality that prevents them from noticing the bad of their actions. We agree.', 'But, now, suppose we have a complete society that is essentially bad, that that society is corrupted from the bottom up by a certain moral liberality or spiritual decline that makes its attachment to traditional goodness very relative or almost non-existent.', 'So my question is: what happens in that case?', \". That's pretty much what happens...\", 'I was actually thinking of something more sci-fi. As in the area of Space Opera. Dune approaches, but tangentially. Asimov, Heinlein, and O.S. Card are loaded more towards the military macro-political side. And they also follow the typical hero-antagonist scheme where basically everything revolves around the MC', '', '\"vary massively\"? I think that is a common assumption among some. There is also the quite fictional idea that content suitable for children would automatically not appeal to adults. This is followed by the idea that adults require a certain type of story.', '', 'When American comic books attempted to make their stories more adult they failed. This was reported in a credible source. In other words, attempts in that direction failed because of the entrenched idea that comic books are for kids.', '', \"Going back to the topic, evil, today, has regressed. It is now more psychotic, more graphic in terms of blood and gore, and sometimes still attempts the decades-long campaign to make profanity acceptable. Game of Thrones is an example of an attempt to market bad behavior as 'entertainment.' I watched a bit and switched it off.\", '', 'So, using TV as an example, the good and evil in Supergirl has broad appeal. Anyone who wants to sell books should look at it. Then look at the current top-selling SF books.

As such, I\\'ll start a new thread for the sake of this topic, so that we may explore this idea without hijacking another thread.', 'Maybe not moral relativism, but I think there are definitely philosophers who argue for moral nihilism/anti-realism/skepticism.', 'Oh sure. Sarte is my go to example for that. Moral nihilism is exposed to many of the same critiques as relativism (apart from the self-contradictory one), but I should have included that on my list as distinct. Thanks for bringing this up!', 'My apologies! I just realized I never posted a response to this!', '', 'The first two that come to mind are', 'and', '.

The threat posed by another assassin, the formidable alien Yavobo, holds Reva pinned to the mainline – the reality she is now in – due to her reluctance to abandon her new friends to their fate.

Endless recounting of memories (mostly not even in flashback form just recounting of those memories). Endless internal thoughts from the main protagonist (usually whining about what a terrible deal she has got), endless repetitions (yes, I know Mahit is lonely without her imago, you’ve told me this literally dozens of times already, I KNOW this). Endless detailed descriptions of what everyone is wearing and how they smile with their eyes not their mouths (I get it I really do, I don’t need to be told dozens and dozens of times). Bizarre use of expressions; maybe they were Americanisms I’m not familiar with, but most American authors seem to manage to not bombard me with so many odd ways of putting things. Constantly interrupting dialogue with several pages of thought explaining one item from that conversation, so that, by the time we return to the dialogue, I’ve forgotten the topic. Strange habits; everyone seems to hiss through their teeth and lick the backs of their spoons. I have nothing against such habits but I’m not sure I need to have it described to me quite so many times. Anomalous technologies: a vast star empire with jump gates and everything yet no email, instead message are encoded onto ‘infofiche’ sticks with wax seals (which even Martine admits are easily opened and resealed) that will display the message holographically but have to be collected by a person and physically delivered to the recipient.

So how do two people write a book anyway?  How does that work? ).  Ok, another book One in a series, this time about a team of misfits as cadets, and a mission.  Both authors have multiple novels to their credit.', '', \"Sixth Row.  Five anthologies on this row, including ones on Greg Egan and R.A. Lafferty.  I'll have a quick peek at\", \"by Chris Beckett.  A mystery about aliens in the 1990's Amazon jungle, and their effect on the human subconscious.  Not quite my cup of tea.\", '', \"Seventh Row. Second Star Wars novel.  And again another row of unknown (to me) authors.  Let's try\", 'by Simon Morden.   This looks a little different.  An alien probe lands in a warzone and collects info about humans.  It probably doesn\\'t jot down \"Mostly Harmless\" in its notebook.', '', \"Eighth Row.  The third Star Trek novel.  For a row selection, let's go with\", 'by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  Hmmm.  Lost planet with something sinister hidden away.  Probably a mixture of SF/Horror?  It is a sequel to', \".  Not that I know that novel either.  Looking at the author's books (and there are a few), fantasy seems to dominate.\", '', 'Ninth Row.  I picked', 'by David Koepp.  A biochemical organism is on the loose.  Now, after reading the synopsis, I have a bit of difficulty categorizing this as SF and  not as horror.  Oh, and the third Star Wars novel is on this row. And the fourth Star Trek.', '', \"Tenth Row.  Another Star Trek novel.  Let's have a look at\", 'by John Birmingham.  A space opera on a galactic scale with five leading heroes.  This novel looks like a slight change of genre for this author; his previous three books dealt with alternate variations of WW2.', '', 'Eleventh Row.  Elizabeth Bear pops up again with', '.  Synopsis is very brief \"Love has no time limits, but life does.\"  And this row has the first Doctor Who book, written by Tom Baker.  I always liked him as Doctor Who back in the seventies.

I'm really in the boondocks; I've never heard of this.\", '', 'Twelve Row.  One anthology and the fourth Star Wars novel. That makes five Star Treks and four Star Wars books in the first ninety-six.  And there is a title here that catches my attention:', \"by Yoon Ha Lee.  Wow, this is interesting.  He writes a lot of short stories.  His Hexarchate stories look intriguing.  And he's a New York Times bestselling author too.  I'm not in the boondocks, I'm out in the muskeg.  I've never heard of him.  Anyway, back to the book.  A space opera with a protagonist that can use fox-magic.  Different.\", '', '', \"That was an interesting little exercise.    I learned that I don't know much about the modern SF market nor the more recent writers.  Maybe I'll have to do something about that.  And  I didn't see any SF that hit the sweet spot for me: space opera with good characters (regular Janes and Joes) along with an interesting plot.  But boy, with over 1300 SF novels written in the last 3 years, that is a lot to go through.  That's why I like getting recommendations here at SFF Chronicles!\", \"I also thank Ashley R - I've been looking over that a lot since that post.\", '', '(The one thing I don\\'t like about it, though, is that nearly half the items are either actual short fiction or things (like novellas published as books) that ought to be short fiction and, while you can filter based on category, you can\\'t just say \"show me books and not non-books\" - you can only either see everything or pick one of novels/collections/anthologies/non-fiction/etc.)', '', \"From the first page, I recognize most of the names but I've only recall reading Di Filippo, Cadigan, Palwick, Cherryh, Turtledove, Bear, McCarthy, Chiang, Yoachim, Cambias, Kowal, Corey, Greenblatt, Beckett, Egan, Lafferty, Chu, Jones, Liu, Hvide, Kritzer, Skillingstead, Anders, Larson, and Lee but I've only read stories by most of those. The ones I've read earlier books by are Cadigan, Cherryh, Cambias, and Egan. The only 2019 book I've read so far is the Cambias (\", '). Cadigan wrote some of the best stories of the 80s and wrote several good cyberpunk novels; Cherryh is a great writer of gritty space stories as well as odd aliens and the odder humans among them; Cambias writes a different novel every time. His first is like Clement and his third is like Vance. And Egan is one of the best hard SF authors around. Of the others, Bear has written some good stuff which ranges from a Bolo-like AI tank story to a Lovecraftian space opera horror sequence - I usually use \"literary SF\" as an insult and wouldn\\'t apply that to her, though she\\'s certainly literate. Chiang is one of the best story writers going and had one of them turned into the relatively recent movie,', '. Kritzer has written a good story about AI and another about ghosts. Larson has written several usually facile and often derivative but almost always skillful and effective stories. I think less of the rest though Lafferty is a famed oddball.', '', \"(Then there are the editors and their anthologies, of course, but that's a different deal.)\", '', \"As far as space operas with good characters, as I said, I haven't read these titles but, based on past experience and looking over all the 2019 items listed, I'd figure the Hamilton and Asher were likely in that ballpark (and possibly the Baxter and others) while the Bova, Cherryh, and McDevitt probably have a lot of space and the Cambias and Nagata have (or probably have) planetary romance aspects.\", '', \"(Kind of funny that you post this as it's almost like a thread I was going to start involving\", \"and their forthcoming books list, which I'll go ahead and start soon.)\", 'For those who wonder and have to hunt...', '', '', 'There is the thread.', 'Here is the link...', '', 'I’ve read Children of Time and Children of Ruin and they are brilliant.
